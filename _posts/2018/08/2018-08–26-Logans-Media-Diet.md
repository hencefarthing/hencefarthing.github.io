# My Media Diet 
I've decided to also take a page from Alex's book, and add a bit of a review to each of these. But no spoilers.
- **_Origins_ by Dan Brown** â€” This was a fun read, if not a literary masterpiece. If you've read any Dan Brown books before, the blend of science, art, history, and nonsense will seem familiar. Due to some travel difficulties, I ended up reading this in less than 24 hours, which I think actually enhanced the experience because the book occurs over a similarly brief time frame.
- **A few episodes of _Fixer Upper_** â€” My wife loves this show, and decided she wants to rewatch it to help give her inspiration in some of the home crafts and decorations she has been making. Each episode is entertaining, and gives us both pretty good ideas about what to do with our house and to make each room meaningful in some way.
- **_Last Week Tonight with John Oliver_** â€” We watch the sections he puts on YouTube. They are typically a mixture of amusing, depressing, aggravating, and informative. Obviously he has a bit of a liberal lean, but this is not my only nor primary source of news. (You'll see that later in the list)
- **Kurzgesagt** â€” I subscribe to few educational YouTube channels because I like to learn. Kurzgesagt is my favorite art style of all of them. Here's the videos that have come out in the last month or so:
	- [What If You Detonated a Nuclear Bomb In The Marianas Trench?](https://youtu.be/9tbxDgcv74c)
	- [Wormholes Explained â€” Breaking Spacetime](https://youtu.be/9P6rdqiybaw)
- **Veritaseum** â€” Another educational YouTube channel with a more personal style.
	- [The World in UV](https://youtu.be/V9K6gjR07Po)
	- [Can You Overdose on Vitamins?](https://youtu.be/AY6Bg4GzCGs)
	- [Is Our Food Becoming Less Nutritious?](https://youtu.be/Yl_K2Ata6XY)
- **Podcasts** â€” I have over 30 subscriptionsâ€¦ ðŸ˜². You can find my list with any private/members only feeds removed [here][1]. Maybe I'll even add some of my own thoughts and comments to that page. 
- **Blog Posts** â€” My RSS reader indicates I have 23 subscriptions hereâ€¦ I would like to reiterate the shocked emoji from earlier. They are mostly tech blogs with a smattering of comics. I'll just list my recommendations that seem more universal, or that Alex might enjoy.[^2]
	- [And Now It's All This](leancrew.com/all-this/) â€” This blog is relatively low volume. Dr. Drang is an Apple nerd, but he's also a mechanical engineer and excellent coder. I enjoy virtually every one of his posts, from a deep dive on why his toothbrush broke to a script he wrote to automate how to create invoices for his clients. 
	- [Kottke.org - home of fine hypertext products](kottke.org) â€” This is a high volume feed, mostly links. About six each day Jason Kottke add his own thoughts and includes parts of the linked post. About six he just links to. He finds lots of cool and interesting things covering all kinds of inereststs
	- [Stratechery by Ben Thompson](stratechery.com) â€” He publishes one free post per week, and 3 members only posts per week. I do occasionally skip a post here and there, but for the most part they are interesting insights into a world I know not much at all about: the business strategy of tech companies. I definitely recommend giving it a shot, even if you just try a couple articles and decide its not your cup of tea.
- **_Doctor Strange_** â€” I rewatched this to listen to an episode of the The Incomparable. I forgot how much I enjoy this movie.
- **_Avengers: Infinity War_** â€” My wife wanted to rewatch this, and who am I to disagree. On the first viewing I didn't like it so much, but every time I re-watch it, it grows on me. The crown jewel[^3] of the MCU so far.
- **The Economist** â€” This _is_ my primary source of news. They only update once a week, so I don't go crazy. They tend to take a stance roughly in middle. And they're a world news magazine, so any US-centric problems I may get absorbed in tend to be put in a bit more reasonable perspective.
- **National Geographic** â€” Sometimes I read a story. But mainly I like the pictures. 
- **Explained** â€” A series on Netflix, we've watched a few episodes of it so far. It is pretty enjoyable. But we often forget that we want to watch it, sooâ€¦ yeah.
-  **_Sourcery_ by Terry Pratchett** â€” I've been working my way through the Discworld series[^4], starting with the books starring Rincewind. If anyone has stronger opinions on how to proceed, let me know. I adore this series of books, they are nonsensical in a humorous way and poke fun at all the fantasy tropes. They treat the fantasy genre the same way the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series treats the sci-fi genre. Add on that the books don't have chapters and are relatively shorts, they make for perfect nightly reading before bed.
