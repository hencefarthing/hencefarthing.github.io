I think Logan or I already came up with the idea of a "collaborative" post, and today I'm thinking about it more than ever.

Why?

Because I just found this YouTube channel ([*Sean Townsend*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4p9kiiXzLalJ5e2DnbQQwg)) where some dude writes beautiful piano cover songs of existing metal music!!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± I don't want to lose track of this channel, and I would love to have a post where we keep track of recommendations for anything - and we continually update it.

What do you think, Logan? ;)

Some ideas for topics in such a post:
- Music
- Games
- Software
- Restaurants

We could even have a separate type of articles we write that are collabs, or we could pin some posts to the top of our site, or anything. Let's get funky ðŸ¤©
