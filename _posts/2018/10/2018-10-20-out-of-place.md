I recently took part in another ultimate-spreading event in Cairo. This event was hosted by [Biker Zone](http://www.bikerzone-eg.com), a community of... uhhh. bikers? Ok, honestly I now I know what kind of people show up at Biker Zone events, but I didn't know anything about it or what it represented before I showed up to the expo and tried showing people what ultimate is. My friend Tarek first mentioned the event back in early August of 2018, but he didn't seem to know all of the details either. We just mentioned that his friend is helping organizing the event, and she would love to have us join. ALSO we would be able to show people ultimate. Obviously, we were in!

# Prepping for the event

The actual date of the expo doesn't really have any significance, but I'm going to mention it anyway. The Biker Zone expo occurred on October 12 and 13, 2018. Ok, so that wasn't super critical to mention, except I find it interesting because my buddies started preparing for the event on... Can you guess? October 8th. A solid 4 days in advance. We actually had meant to prepare more before, like we talked about inviting more people and about making flyers and stuff, but the real work began 4 days in advance. We split tasks into developing flyers, buying a tent, getting a table and chairs, and preparing what we would do as the event "performance". This last one was my job. At first I was a bit confused what the heck an ultimate "performance" should be, but I thought it was supposed to be something like a "presentation" so I decided we'd just show the people what it looks like to play ultimate. Dani would describe some basic rules while we played, and afterwards anyone could come play near our tend and learn about the sport and where they could play in Cairo. I thought this would be a good way to lure a few people into playing the sport, right? Well... Let's continue the story...

# Arriving at the event

Friday the 12th shows up, and a few friends and I Uber to Biker Zone. Somehow, up to this point I assumed this was going to be an event of bicyclers or something, maybe a sporty type of event where everyone's showing off some type of activity that isn't super popular in Egypt yet (like ultimate!). My first reaction was that there were a surprising number of motorcycles in the parking lot. I noticed a few dudes walking around in leather jackets, but that didn't phase me too much yet. The closer we got to this little patch of grass inside [Cairo Festival City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cairo+Festival+City,+Nasr+City,+Cairo+Governorate/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14583cfd5e540799:0x4a397398c27f4413?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0stPO7ZXeAhWCCMAKHbzRD_4Q8gEwD3oECAoQCw), the more we could hear motorcycles revving engines, and there were some people racing around remote controlled trucks (not little cars, but *relatively* big trucks). Thus begins the beginning of a slightly unsettling feeling that our little frisbee family was a bit out of place...

After chillin inside a bit, we got a few groups of people to toss discs with us! One group was the Cairo Wolves, an American Football team based in Maadi. They were super friendly and loved tossing discs, but eventually you could tell some got a little bored and discs slowly turned to Footballs, and so we slowly phased out and tried new audience members. I continued to notice that the majority of the "participants" at Biker Zone were "bikers" - like the leather jacket biker I mentioned ealier...

Then we made our way to the middle of the event, where there was lots of open space. We hoped we could set up a fun game or at least attract more people there since the main entrance to the event led straight to us, and we could see the main stage quite well. After about 15 minutes of tossing around, Dani comes up to me and tells me it's time to prepare the area for the "performance" (like set up cones) and we have to make it work right next to the stage. I know you haven't seen how much space there is near the stage... But it's basically the size of one endzone within a classic 5v5 field we often play pickups and tournaments on. Yes, I said that correctly - the entire space we had to do our "performance" in was the size of ONE ENDZONE in our normal week-to-week pickup games. I'd say it was close to 10 x 25 yards. This was much smaller than a typical full-field enzone in ultimate, but it was all we were given to use, so we had to make the best out of it. [^1] After a few minutes, we hear the announcement - "Let's give it up for our friends at Flying Disc Invasion!" [^2]

# "Performance" time

By the time we all make it up to the front of the stage, there's a pretty decent crowd gathered, listening to the speaker! This is great, we'll have a nice crowd watching! Sadly... it turns out they weren't ready to watch us, they were standing in our field watching some hip-hop dancer who was showing his moves up on the stage. For a moment, it seemed like we got skipped over... Okay, don't panic, what to do... My buddies and I have a little team meeting during the seemingly impromptu hip-hop dance concert and we decide to wait it out. We all assume that after the show we'll still get some time to "perform" our segment. After 6 songs, 2 dancers, and a decent amount of awkward tension in the group, GAME TIME! Nope, not yet... The dance crew takes it to the audience... The audience now forms a circle and one by one, some ladies and some dudes show off their moves. My buddies and I are feeling more and more out of place at this point.

Finally, about 7 minutes later, the dance circle dies down and we got a second beautiful announcement from the megaphone. "Ok, now it's time for amazing performance from Flying Disc Invasion! Let's give it up!" A few people cheered, but mostly people were quiet and confused... They had no idea what a "disc invasion" was, and why is it flying? Dani makes his way to the stage and begins giving some rules of the game, and a little about who we are. At this point, the crowd looks a bit dumbfounded... Like... How did we go from this cool crazy hip-hop dancing to hearing about some weird sport? Dani tells the crows that we'll be showing off our sport in front of the stage, in the area marked off by our eight cones [^4]. While this was going on, I halved our group into 2 teams, split them to both sides of the "field", and set the basic rules we would be using for the next half hour - stall to 7, and only one pull to start the match.

>Quick test for you ultimate nuts out there: How does one "usually" start a point in Ultimate? Do you know? One team "pulls" the disc to the other team! I get ready to pull, but I realize something is wrong...

>Quick test #2: Should you start a game of ultimate when there's still 30 spectators midlessly wandering inside your field? Answer: Probably not? Is there a real answer to this question?

We were ready to start showing Biker Zone how to play ultimate, but somehow there were still 30 - 40 biker dudes & chicks in the middle of our field! These attendees had just been getting their groove on, and were not super ready to get off the field for some scrawney people wanting to play some "ultimate". After a bit of convincing, Noman and Meto (and probably Dani) coerced them off the field. Ok phew, now it's finally game time. I pull the disc to the other team and we start playing. The sideline is now packed with bikers and football players who are watching the game intently. [^3] We score some points, the other team does the same. We're all having fun playing our little match. 15 minutes in, the announcer gets back on the megaphone: "Okay, thank you Flying Disc Invasion for teaching us about Ultimate Frisbee!" That's it? Was that a hint? We finished the point, collected the cones, and retreated to our corner of the event grounds.

# Back at our corner

We continued tossing for a few hours since we got about 3 new people to come toss some discs! Did they see our "performance" or did they just randomly stop by? Who knows, but I'm definitely glad they did! One of the gentlemen who tossed with us was a man named Amgad. He is a P.E. teacher at a school in Cairo, and he had played ultimate before! In fact, he used to toss discs before ultimate was ever available in Cairo! Additionally, as a P.E. teacher, he taught some of his students how to play ultimate! We chatted for a while about what each other is doing in Egypt, what we're doing at the event, etc. I told him that our initiative Flying Disc Invasion is trying to spread ultimate across Egypt, so if we could plan an event at his school, that would be great. Cutting this part short, I'm pretty excited about the potential future opportunity to work with Amgad and his school to spread ultimate. After meeting him, I really began to believe that FDI was not totally out of place at Biker Zone. Ok, we didn't get any real bikers or American Football players super interested in the sport, but if all that came of the event was this one connection - a REAL connection, it was all 100% worth it and I'm happy.

Just a quick note - on day 2, we wrapped up earlier than we originally expected. The few of us there didn't really want to go through another weird "performance" (plus, we were supposed to perform earlier on day 2, and not many people were at the event early in the day). So as we packed up, the event organizer (who invited us and gave us time to "perform" on both days) saw us leaving and came to try to persuade us to stay! I told her "You know, ultimate doesn't really seem to fit in this kind of event with buff biker duders and American football players..." I believed that to an extent, while also trying to just provide a credible excuse as to why we were leaving early. To my surprise, she disagreed with me! She told me that ultimate was definitely welcome at the event, and that she loved what we had done the day before. Sadly, most of us already had committed to other plans at that point (more ultimate - this time in my neighborhood) so we didn't end up "performing" on day 2. But it still gave me hope and made me feel that sometimes it may seem like you're not in the right place or doing the right thing, but you may just not be seeing all sides of the story. Don't give up. Follow your passion.

# Thanks

That's all for now! Potential more updates to follow. Hope you enjoyed the story :)

[^1]: Ok, so it's small... We can do this. We used to play on smaller fields (mind you, that's when we played Old Man Frisbee, in weekly walks).

[^2]: At this exact moment, I'm helping my friend find our tent and get ready, so we quickly hurry up & race to the stage.

[^3]: Probably because there's nothing else for them to do at this point...

[^4]: We had to reset a few after some kids WOULD NOT stop moving them around...
