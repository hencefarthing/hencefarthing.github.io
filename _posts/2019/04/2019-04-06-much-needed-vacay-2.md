title: Sri Lanka - A Much Needed Vacation (Part 2)
categories: travel sri-lanka uncategorized

Alright, well it's three months later and I'm finally continuing my tales of adventure in Sri Lanka! The delay has been due to: 1) a promotion at work, 2) starting (and not finishing) three other posts, 3) continual planning of frisbee events (we just finished one at the end of March), 4)... Too much Netflix.

Anyway, in case you don't remember part 1 [^1] of this series, I gave a brief explanation into why Dina and I traveled to Sri Lanka, what our itinerary was, and our experiences just _getting to_ the hotel in Colombo. In this post I plan to collect two days of our exploratory, delicious, and slightly off-the-wall adventures that we had in **Colombo**. Enjoy :)

# Friday, 16 Nov 2018 - The better half

... And it's morning time! I woke up so bright and fresh and energetic, absolutely rip-roarin' PUMPED for the day!

Wait a minute, I must be thinking of a different trip...

Oh right, now I remember where I left off... Dina and I had just barely arrived at [Anarva](https://www.booking.com/hotel/lk/anarva-mount-lavinia.en-gb.html) [^2], the hotel we planned to stay at for the next 3 nights. It's now 9:00am [^3] and all we can think about is getting to our rooms and _passing out_.

We stagger through the main entrance like a couple of zombies smelling brains up ahead. The main entrance is about as plain as possible - the marble-tiled room is not much larger than my living room in Cairo, and the only doors are for baggage check and 3 elevators. The friendly bellman (I forgot his name!!) takes our bags and instructs us to head to the lobby floor for check-in [^4].

Dina and I follow his instructions and we arrive in the Lobby. We stumble toward the check-in desk and plop ourselves onto the not-so-comfortable easy chairs. The lady behind the desk immediately recognizes us as Dina and Alex, as we're probably the only two weirdos checking in this early on a Friday morning. Before asking for our passports or method of payment, she gives us some disappointing news: It's 9:00am now and we won't be able to check in until 12:00pm, or 11:30am at the absolute earliest. Rats... No luck for us...

Not sure how we'd kill two and a half hours, we inquired about nearby breakfast restaurants. Our hotel, Anarva, boasts delicious breakfast included in the fees, but sadly (and understandably) we have to wait until the next day to cash in on this delicious deal. Responding to our disappointment, the lady at the front desk told us about a breakfast place across the street called [The Fab](https://goo.gl/maps/FhAfEVFFrsK2). Here's how Google Maps shows the quaint little bakery:

![The Fab](/images/srilanka/TheFab.jpg)

From the outside, it has the vibes of a hip restaurant where people go to grab some coffee and maybe some delicious pastries. However, once inside, I was underwhelmed by the lack of excitement or "cool vibes" in the establishment. The few customers were very quiet and the atmosphere seemed bleak.

There were tasty looking cakes and pies in a display by one counter, but this early in the morning I was craving something more savory. There was no menu for these items, just a few glass-protected displays of baked goods. I wasn't feeling super friendly that morning, so I didn't feel like asking what each item was made of. Instead, I ended up just grabbing 4 or 5 small items and sharing them with Dina. I struggled to hold a conversation with Dina since I was delirious from lack of sleep, but we eventually came up with a plan to finish our food, grab some snacks from a nearby market, then head back to the hotel to ask if we could sleep next to the pool on their roof.

Okay, one step at a time, Alex. Ready... set... go!

We finished our breakfast and walked back across the street to shop for snacks at a local market [^5]. We took our time looking around since we still had about 2 hours to kill, and we were having fun giggling at some ridiculous Sri Lankan snacks. We ended up purchasing some onion flavored crispies (we both love Funyons), chocolate milk, and one or two more items I can't remember. Feeling pretty satisfied, we get ready to purchase our items and find everyone around staring at us... There's two or three casheers and a few locals who apparently weren't ready to see two foreigners shopping in their favorite market that morning 😂. Dina and I escaped our moment of fame and headed back to the hotel.

After arguing with the front desk lady for what seemed like ages, we barely managed to convince her to let us sleep on their roof while waiting for our check-in time. **Just kidding** :) Every staff member at Anarva was very kind and helpful. Once they saw us zombies back inside, they quickly recommended that we go up to the roof and nap by the pool. Was this because I smelled like B.O. and we both looked like we hadn't slept in weeks? Did the managers want to keep us out of sight so we wouldn't scare off customers? It's quite possible... But I choose to believe the hotel staff are just very friendly and accommodating to all customers.

Dina and I made our way to the rooftop pool and got comfortable on the plastic lounge chairs [^6]. Initially this felt like heaven - a nice warm sun beating down on my tired body, busses and tuktuks sounding far, far away... I felt like this whole trip was worth it just so I could take that incredible nap. As the time approached 11am, the sun got a bit too intense so we moved under the little available shade. The air was also pretty humid, so my skin felt more and more sticky. I never longed so stongly for a nice hot shower.

Finally, 11:30am came and we were desparate to check in to our rooms. We heaved our bodies into the elevator and out dragged ourselves back to the check-in desk, hopefully for the last time. We were finally met with some fantastic news: our rooms were ready and they would let us check in! As quickly and efficiently as possible, we paid for our stay, grabbed our keys, and ran to our rooms. I don't know how methodical Dina was in preparing for sleep, but I do know that I wasn't concerned with tact. I burst in, threw my bags on the floor, (thanked the friendly bellman), and fell in bed. Dina and I had discussed a mini plan for the evening - sleeping for 4 or 5 hours, then eating dinner somewhere nearby. At the time, that plan sounded logical, but once I hit my face on my pillow, I didn't care if I slept for 24 or **50** hours. 

I awoke some magical 5 - 6 hours later, ready to find a delicious restaurant and return to my safe haven (my bed) once more. After some quick searching on Google Maps, we decided to take a tuk tuk to a nearby seafood restaurant, [Buba Beach Seafood](https://goo.gl/maps/2DKJsNgLpqp). Here's a picture of the map to show how close it is to the hotel:

![Walking route from Anarva to Buba Beach Seafood](/images/srilanka/AnarvaToBubaBeachSeafood.jpg)

The location of this restaurant was incredible. It's located directly on the beach and has groups of tables blocked from the sight of others by palm trees and bushes. It felt spacious and yet private at the same time. Dina and I had the option to sit at a secluded table in the sand but we chose to climb stairs onto a clubhouse-looking patio. Here we could easily hear and smell the sea, and we were still far enough from others that we felt some privacy. The lighting on the patio was also perfect. Apart from one electric lightbulb far from us, we ate by candlelight. Candles were housed in a glass lamp so they wouldn't get blown out by the persistent winds flowing over the sea.

![Bubba seafood candle light](/images/srilanka/BubbaCandleLight.jpeg)

For dinner, we shared a few assorted plates of seafood and fresh juice. I remember ordering delicious fried shrimp, a small order of lobster, and the most buttery and delicious calamari I've ever tasted. Combined with delectable, fresh-squeezed passion fruit juice, this was the absolute perfect end to day #1 in Sri Lanka [^7].

Dina and I let time slip by as we chilled in the incredible atmosphere at the restaurant. As I mentioned before, our purpose for this trip was to find some soul healing and sitting here, enjoying our time together, was directly achieving that purpose.

Eventually we did agree that we needed to go home to get a complete night's sleep. We wandered down the beach for a few final minutes before grabbing a tuktuk and returning to the hotel. If I ever make my way back to Colombo in the future, I'm definitely going to make a strong effort to eat at Buba Beach Seafood once more.

With that... We slept.

# Saturday, 17 Nov 2018

On Saturday morning all I could think about was: what would be available at the hotel breakfast?? Would there be pancakes? Sausage? Just-Add-Water Eggs? Curry? Chicken? Something delicious smelling? Working at Epic 2.5 years ago, I got pretty used to staying in hotels with a variety of breakfast options. Sometimes there was a full buffet available with pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and omlets. Other hotels offered only slightly stale bagles and Sunny D [^8].

Anarva, on the other hand, had a wide variety of options available. There were hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit, multiple types of curry, freshly cooked omlets with any ingredients we desired, and even some sweet baked goods! Breakfast was buffet style so I had to go back a few times 🤭 That's the polite thing to do, after all... [^9] This was definitely the highlight of my trip _so far_. Ok, should I move on in the story, or... Ok, ok I'll show you a picture of the delicious food :)

![Yummy, right?](/images/srilanka/AnarvaBreakfast.jpeg)

If you're like me, delicious food in large quantities gives you a few feelings:
1. Enlightenment
1. Slightly bloated
1. Can I have some more?
1. Food coma 😴

Lucky for me, Dina already had the mindset that we would be **relaxing** and **de-stressing** on this trip. We happily took the next few hours to let our food babies digest a bit.

Eventually we decided it was time to begin the Colombo adventure! Dina had already done detailed planning of sites to see and how to efficiently travel between each, so all I had to do was get my touristy clothes on and get out the door! I almost felt like Dina was my tourguide and I was on a trip designed for lazy people. Not because I hadn't moved my body much at this point, but because I hadn't done any research into "tourist destinations of Colombo" or "What Colombo is known for" - Dina had done all of that for us. [^10]

To get downtown from our hotel, we decided to take a local bus. The friendly bellman had warned us that tuk tuk drivers charged much more money and were often slower than busses, so we opted for the slightly more hectic transportation method that only cost 30 rupees. We got to the street and found tons of busses, each with legible numbers on the front indicating which route they would take. There were no maps of these bus routes inside the hotel lobby nor inside busses, but thankfully Google Maps had sufficiently and accurately mapped out the system [^11]. On Gmaps (and with the help of the bellman), it was easy to see we had to take bus route #30 to get downtown, close to our first tourist destination.

## Seema Malaka Temple

When we got off the bus in downtown Colombo, we quickly oriented ourselves with [MAPS.ME](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en) and shuffled off to our first temple exploration. We started with [Seema Malaka Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Malaka), a small temple that resides on an island in the middle of [Beira Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beira_Lake). For those of you still following the few price points along our trip, the ticket price for visiting this and one other nearby temple was 300 rupees. We weren't allowed to wear shoes or hats on the island (following common [etiquette for visiting Buddhist temples](https://www.tripsavvy.com/visiting-buddhist-temples-dos-and-donts-1629907)), but luckily they let us take pictures everywhere except inside the sacred temple. Although we followed protocol and composed ourselves as much as possible, we had to take at least one fun picture with a few of the main statues:

![Seema Malak Alex Asleep](/images/srilanka/SeemaMalak1.jpeg)

Seema Malaka was a perfect first destination in our trip because it contained so many things Dina and I hadn't experienced in a long time. **First**, the surrounding nature. In the photo above, you can see there was so much green around this island. There were beautiful trees, flowers, and even Biera Lake was calm and serene - sights not often seen while living in Cairo. **Second**, peace and quiet. Dina and I were very excited to experience our first Buddhist temple together, so we were understandably a bit giddy with anticipation. I would argue we were never "too loud" but one employee at the temple asked us to keep our voices down (yes, this was the same man who reminded me to remove my hat - oops). Being quiet in this place increased our enjoyment as it kept us focused on the purity and sacred nature of our surroundings.

On one corner of the island, we took some pictures of each other, focusing the lense toward the opposite side of the lake. A few hundred yards away, we saw a slightly larger island, filled with trees and other vegetation, connected to the mainland with a narrow bridge. We had to go check it out!

## Gangaramaya Park

On our way to the lush [Gangaramaya Park](https://www.facebook.com/GangaramayaPark/), we stopped to take the picture below.

![Gangaramaya Park](/images/srilanka/GangaramayaPark.jpeg)

>I love this photo because it reminds me how happy the two of us were on this entire trip [^12]. This is the first trip I'd ever been on with the main purpose of renewing & refreshing my mind. Often when I travel, I load up each day with as many activities as possible, "to make the trip worthwhile." This trip had basically the opposite goal, and time and time again Dina and I have noted how amazing this trip was because we were so calm and relaxed about the agenda for each day. We planned, on average, 1 or 2 things we _really_ wanted to do each day, and the rest of the time was up to how we felt in the moment. I hope to have more adventures like this with Dina in the future 😍

Okay, back to the trip ;) At the park, Dina and I ate some sandwiches, took some pictures, and fed a few geese. Although we were thoroughly enjoying our time, we decided we wanted to hit up one more temple (the 2nd temple in our pass), then we would head home for the day.

## Gangaramaya Temple

The last site we visited on this Saturday was [Gangaramaya Temple](http://gangaramaya.com/attractions/). Inside, we saw a million statues of Buddah, lots of monk statues, historical artifacts, and more. This temple was made up of multiple buildings and again we had to take off our shoes and hats before entering. The Gangaramaya Temple is larger and more famous than the Seema Malaka Temple so it had signs guiding tourists through the many hallways and pointing out the must-sees. There were even many people inside praying at a holy [Bodhi Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Tree) (pictured below).

![Tree of Life](/images/srilanka/TreeOfLife.jpeg)

Dina and I sat and watched while many people came to pray and water the Bodhi tree for a few minutes. The air was cool and we were happy to chill and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. At this point in the day, we had been on our feet for a while and the sun had drained most of our energy, so it was nice to find some relaxation in the shaded temple grounds.

I don't have much more to say about our visit at Gangaramaya Temple, but I want to share a few of my favorite photos taken here :)

## Back Home

After two bus rides (20 and 25 rupees respectively), we arrived back at our hotel and quickly headed to the rooftop infinity pool. We wanted to catch the sunset before leaving for dinner, and we did! I had to flex [^13] because I was so happy with the view, the day, and my incredible travel companion.

![Infinity pool at sunset](/images/srilanka/InfinityPoolSunset.jpeg)

Finally, it was time for dinner! Dina and I took a tuk tuk [^14] in the rain to a nearby restaurant called [Arthur's Pizzeria](https://www.facebook.com/arthurspizzas). The pizzas we shared were absolutely incredible. Dina ordered the chicken bacon pizza, and I ordered the mutton pizza. The atmosphere was similar to that of Woody's Pizza in Golden, Colorado - the lights were dim, there was beer for sale, fresh pizza scent filled the air, and a groovy mix of electronic and rap music played in the background. We stayed at Arthur's until about 10:30pm, when we both realized we were going to fall asleep if we didn't catch a ride home quickly. We paid 4640 rupees for the meal, rode home, and quickly fell asleep.

# Sunday, 18 Nov 2018...

Sunday adventures will have to wait until next time :)

This post is already much longer than I expected, even though it only covers 2 days! I hope I haven't been going into _too much_ detail... I absolutely loved my time with Dina in Sri Lanka, so I have so much to talk about ❤ Below is a screenshot from Google Maps showing the 4 main sights we saw today: Beira Lake (spelled "Bere" by Google), Seema Malakaya Temple, Gangaramaya Park, and finally Gangaramaya Temple. It may seem like we could have fit more into our day, but I am 150% satisfied with the day.

# Thanks

That's all for now! Again, it took a loonggg time to write this post, so I hope you enjoyed it! It's amazing re-living the adventure while writing about it. I would highly recommend for everyone to take notes while on any trip, then trying to fill out those notes with more detail later. For me, this process helps me re-live the experiences and it has brought back some unforgettable memories.

[^2]: Avarna? Avinia? (Inside joke between Dina & me)

[^3]: After 2 flights + 1 bus + 1 tuk tuk ride, weeeeeee were ridiculously tired... And a bit smelly 🙈

[^4]: We knew we'd be a bit too early to check in, but here's to hoping!

[^5]: Honestly, I'm not sure if "Market" is the right word for the store we entered. It felt like a snack shop you would regularly see at gas stations in Colorado, or maybe a large Egyptian kushk.

[^6]: "Comfortable" may not be the perfect word to describe the paddingless chairs, but we were so deadly tired it didn't matter much.

[^7]: For those of you who may be interested, we spent 5151 rupees at Buba Beach Seafood. This comes out to about $28.66 USD or 501.5 Egyptian pounds. I have had simiarly expensive seafood in Egypt, but the taste is absolutely incomparable. This seafood was the best I've had in the past few years, maybe in my entire life.

[^8]: Sunny D... Yum ![Sunny D!](/images/srilanka/SunnyD.jpg)

[^9]: Right, Dad? 😜

[^10]: To be perfectly honest, I did make a few decisions, but they were merely "should we go to this temple or that building first." I'm so lucky Dina loves planning **and** that she's so good at it! :D 

[^11]: Cairo should learn a thing or two from the Google-maps bus system... I haven't found _any_ documentation _anywhere_ about Cairo's microbus routes. You just have to know someone who has painstakingly mapped it out in their own heads.

[^12]: Well... Let's not talk about the pineapple incident(s)... To be discussed in future posts 🤢

[^13]: Hopefully you noticed that I'm using the term "flex" in multiple ways: The obvious way _and_ the way defined by [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Flex)

[^14]: Took a tuk tuk... Haha... Sounds funny if you say it quickly... "tuk a tuk tuk"
