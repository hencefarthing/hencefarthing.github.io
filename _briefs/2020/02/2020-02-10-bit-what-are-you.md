The other day I came across a [`bitly`][1] link I _really_ wanted to click on. If I remember correctly, the "person" [^2] who posted the link was advertising an open "React Front-End Developer" position [^3] with a ridiculously high salary. It seemed a bit too good to be true, so instead of immediately clicking on the link, I researched "how to check the url a bitly link points to" and I got a surprisingly simple and easy [answer][4]!

> ... simply add a + sign to the end of any bitly link in your browser.

That's all?? Yes indeedy! To test, try these links to the `bitly` blog:

-   http://bitly.com/Wn2Xdz <- Go directly to the site (Normally you don't know which site you'll be redirected to, so be careful!)
-   http://bitly.com/Wn2Xdz+ <- Preview the URL `bitly` will redirect you to, and see other details about the link.

Hopefully this comes in handy some day for any readers out there :) Stay safe when clicking those links!
