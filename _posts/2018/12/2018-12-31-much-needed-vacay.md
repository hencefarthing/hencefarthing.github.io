Twenty Eighteen (2018) has proven quite difficult for one of my favorite people. She has suffered through heartbreak, a rejected Schengen visa, multiple new job offers that fell through last minute, and more. That list doesn't even cover her struggles with home life or her current place of employment. To put it lightly, 2018 has been rough. I've tried being there for her when needed - a shoulder to cry on, a place to vent with no judgement, a safe haven where real life can be set aside as we discuss dreamy travel destinations, living a minimalistic lifestyle, and spreading ultimate. But what's better than a person to talk to? Experiencing an entirely new country with new people, food, and culture. That's where Sri Lanka comes in.

# Brief Intro

My trip with Dina to Sri Lanka lasted from November 15th - 23rd. During the 7 full days of being in the country, we visited 3 main cities: [Colombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo), [Kandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy), and [Nuwara Eliya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwara_Eliya). My plan is to write about the trip in multiple posts (like I did for my [Iceland](https://hencefarthing.blog/2018/03/05/Ice1/) trip) so I can actually get this going! I'm already starting this a month after my trip, which is a bit late... Sorry about that... But here we go!

# Thursday, 15 Nov 2018

Our trip begins on Thursday, the 15th of November around 1 pm. I had packed most of my bags that morning (as always) and my Uber driver had been stressing me out a bit [^1] so I was pretty happy to be on time, at the airport, with a very calming presence - Dina. We efficiently checked our bags, passed through customs, and finally proceeded down the hallway towards Duty Free, restaurants, and the gates. Dina and I have been on a few trips together (Manila, USA, and now Sri Lanka) so we know most of the nice places to chill and wait for our plane [^2]. After chatting a bit about our plans and what we're most excited for, Dina heard over the intercom that our plane had almost finished boarding, and was sounding out its `last call` warning message. Oops! So much for no stress! We powerwalked down the escalator, past the coffee shops and over to the gate where we were literally the last two passengers on the plane. [^3] Yikes... As least we're on our way now :)

Our first stop was in Bahrain! I honestly didn't know where Bahrain was, even while I was there haha. So here's a little screenshot showing where Bahrain is, relative to its neighboring countries:

Here we found the exchange rate to be 1 Bahraini Dinar to 47.5 Egyptian Pounds. [^4] We only spent a few hours in the airport (thankfully) before heading to our final destination. The airport hallways in Bahrain felt pretty narrow, but really nothing else about the airport was particularly interesting. Dina and I easily found our gate (even after it changed once) and were ready for our slightly longer flight, our 5 hour leg to Colombo.

# Friday, 16 Nov 2018

We landed in Colombo at 4:40am on Friday morning (There was a slight delay in Bahrain, which was no problem for us. We knew we would get to our hotel way too early anyway... Enough foreshadowing!). Here's another quick screenshot of where we found oursleves so early that morning:

After exchanging a few hundred dollars to rupees, we were ready for the next leg: a 45 minute bus ride from the airport to downtown Colombia. Upon exiting the airport, we were barraged by taxi drivers, uber drivers, and tuk tuks all claiming to have the cheapest prices to get downtown. We believed a bus would be more relaxing and probably cheaper, so we turned down the taxi drivers' "cheapest" offers of about 10 USD. Doing some quick mental math and remembering the exchange rate to be 1 USD to 180 Sri Lankan Rupees, we could only hope the bus would cost less than 1800 rupees. Some helpful airport employees pointed out the bus we would need to take to get to downtown Colombia. [^5] The bus drivers were crazy friendly. They loaded our suitcases into the back of the bus, smiling as they worked, and told us they would leave in about 15 minutes. Also, guess how much each bus ticket costs... A whopping 150 rupees ðŸ˜‚. At this point I started realizing that it's not only Egyptian taxi drivers who try to con foreigners out of cash... Anyway, once our bags were loaded, Dina and I climbed up into the bus and prepared for a quick nap prior to heading out.

Here's a picture of the two of us on the bus. We were quite sleep deprived, in case you can't quite tell. Note: I am not sure if Dina wanted me to share this picture with anyone... Only friends and family will ever be reading this, right? ;)

We waited about 45 minutes with AC leaking through the vents in the roof [^6] before embarking on our joy-ride to downtown Colombo. The next 45 minutes were absolutely incredible. So much green everywhere, lots of water in streams, puddles, lakes... A mentally healing experience. This was absolutely one of the main reasons Dina and I had to escape Egypt for a few days.

Finally we arrived in downtown Colombo, at the main bus station. Next stop? Our hotel called Anarva, located in Mount Lavinia! At the bus station, there were no signs pointing out the "quickest way to Mount Lavinia" or "Alex and Dina, go this way!" so we looked a bit dumbfounded. I asked a few bus drivers how to get to Mount Lavinia, but sadly none of the bus drivers I talked to spoke English! So much for that earlier revelation! We wandered around a bit, and finally a friendly-looking Tuk Tuk driver rolled up to us and asked where we're going. I told him we wanted to get to a train station that would take us to Mount Lavinia, and he told me "that's a long walk with such heavy bags, you'll have to cross some big streets and walk all the way to that tall building" (as he pointed to it). Dina and I began mentally preparing ourselves for the journey, but the driver quickly and instinctively offered us a lift. I hesitated at first as I thought we'd be able to walk it, but we both were pretty exhaused so we hopped in. He immediately hit the ground running his mouth, asking where we're from, how long we're staying, blah blah blah. Dina and I are similar in that we don't like making people feel like we're annoyed with them, so we tried to be friendly and keep up with his conversation (even though we both felt like passing out). A few minutes in, he tries to play the `I'm such a kind person` card as he offers to drive us all the way to Mount Lavinia. Dina and I had been planning to take the train (as we'd read the train was pretty cheap) but the Tuk Tuk driver insisted he take us all the way. I didn't want to do much fighting at that moment so after he told us it would only cost us 1500 rupees, I caved. A bit less than $9 to get a private ride exactly where we wanted to go? Not bad. [^7]

The ride to Mount Lavinia was full of traffic, and our Tuk Tuk driver drove a bit crazily, weaving in and out of traffic, sometimes partially driving in the oncoming lane in order to go a bit faster. As the screenshot from Google Maps above shows, by car the route can take about 50 minutes. This estimate is probably only on a good day, and in a fast enough car. Our Tuk Tuk driver made the trip in a bit over an hour, accounting for the end of the route which was not exactly at that destination "Mount Lavinia". We actually had to go a bit farther, to a relatively new hotel called Anarva. At the writing of this post, that hotel cannot be found on Google Maps! It took us an extra 15 to 20 minutes trying to guide the driver through some streets behind the hotel before we finally found the correct road and entrance. Thinking ahead, Dina had downloaded a useful app called [MAPS.ME](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en) which works online AND offline, so we used this app to guide our driver to the hotel. This app came in handy almost every day during this trip, so I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of traveling in the future :)

*Break time*

# Thanks

That's all for now! 

I'm cutting this one short (is it short?) but there's maaaany interesting bits to come. This post only explained our journey TO the start of our adventures on the island, so hopefully it wasn't too boring :) Next time I'll try to provide more pictures and insight into our first 3 days actually on the island of Sri Lanka.

As always, thanks for reading! Part 2 should be coming soon (ish)


[^1]: Every time I travel, I have a mini stress freakout morning-of the trip. This time my Uber driver was pretty normal, but I never forget [Murphy's law](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law).

[^2]: The Cairo airport has a McDonald's restaurant upstairs which has nice places to sit and is relatively secluded, so this is one of our go-to spots :)

[^3]: One thing I love about traveling with Dina is that she's willing to be the last one on / off of planes in order to avoid even a little bit of stress. I don't feel pressure to get to the gate immediately and sit in uncomfortable chairs for hours, nor do I feel the need to stand up immediately after landing and force my way off the plane as quickly as possible.

[^4]: Or, for those of you who think better in terms of US Dollars, 1 Bahraini Dinar equals 2.65 USD

[^5]: To my delight, Sri Lankans seemed to be very friendly, helpful, and proficient in English! I had read some articles that agreed with what I was experiencing, but I didn't want to be over-confident.

[^6]: Literally every single ceiling vent in the bus was broken. Not in the sense that nothing was coming out, but that nothing was available to stop the cold air from pouring out! Thankfully Architect Dina designed a quick, makeshift solution. She shoved some tissues in the hole, and BLAM we were good to go :)

[^7]: Dina gave me a quick reality check after accepting the offer - any Tuk Tuk driver would most likely offer their highest price initially, so we should always try to bargain for cheaper fares. I believed her, but didn't want to go back on the deal we just struck, so we agreed I'd bargain / haggle from now on.
