Some test code to mess around with! Woot!

## Code

```javascript
document.onload()
console.log()
```
```javascript
let code = "hi".indexOf('this is a test'); // now a really long comment after to see what happens.
```

## tags notes
- Can set up Liquid variables as an array like tihs: `[one, two, 3, two words]`
- OR can set up like this: `one two 3 two-words`
- **Note**: If you want multi-word tags without spaces, must use array `[]` format. Otherwise, just use `-` character between words.
