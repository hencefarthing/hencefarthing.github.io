## one
it started when i was a kid. my mom liked to make cookies, and i _loved_ to help. [^1] she had clipped the recipe off a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips sometime before my memory. that little bit of curled yellow plastic is still in her recipe file. we grew up with those cookies, and with everyone telling us our mom made the best cookies. i couldn't've agreed more.  
i got older and stopped helping as much, because i was a dumb high schooler who didn't understand how valuable any time with your parents is. but my mom still generously baked cookies for me, and whatever school or tennis functions i had.  
  
eventually, i went to college, and was no longer around to help with the baking at all. but because my mom is the best mom, she would still deliver me the best cookies, and i would share them with my roommates. a handful of times i tried baking them myself in our dingy little uncared-for apartment. they never turned out quite right. i didn't know if i had missed lessons during my childhood or if i didn't have the right equipment or if i was just bad. i kept trying, but i resigned myself to always wishing for the best cookies that my mom made instead of what i would come up with.
## two
after college i moved in with my lovely girlfriend, which changed everything. no longer in an apartment full of messy boys, i was a problem. ruining the kitchen, leaving messes everywhere… but slowly i learned. the kitchen became a place people could hang out, and we started inviting people over.  
i tried to make the best cookies in our tidy, well-loved aparment.  
  
we saw good times; we saw bad times. through them all i kept baking.  
i brought cookies in to work to cheer up my coworkers. i started getting compliments on how good my cookies were, and requests to bring them to meetings. i've never been good at taking compliments, so i would shrug it off and then go home and joyously make another attempt.  
  
throughout it all, my mom continued to bring us the best cookies and i would eat them ravenously while wondering what made them different from mine. some technique? my own nostalgia?
## three
time ushered the bad times away from us. i changed companies, we bought a house, we got married.  
for a while i didn't make cookies for my new job. i felt like i wanted to be sure people liked me without the crutch of bribing them with food.  
our new house had a fancy gas stove and a fancy oven. we had a pile of shiny new kitchen gear from our wedding registry. i love baking. i couldn't resist. i started making cookies for work again. and they were welcomed with the praise of my coworkers, but they still weren't the best cookies. so i started tinkering.  
  
molasses and sugar instead of brown sugar  
more molasses  
less molasses  
use cold butter  
melt the butter first  
cool the dough before baking  
don't melt the butter, just soften it  
add cinnamon  
add almond extract  
use more vanilla extract  
beat the dough more after adding eggs  
beat the eggs before adding them  
shape the cokies differently  
higher oven temperature  
more flour  
shorter cook time  
cooler oven  
even more flour  
longer cook time  
and so on…  
  
i love the cookies i bake now. i think they're pretty good.  
i'm proud of _my_ cookies. i'll still keep tinkering. i can't help myself.  

i never did figure out how to make the best cookies. i don't think i ever will.
   
i'm ok with that.  
  
because i figured out that that i don't need to make the best cookies. my mom already makes the best cookies.
