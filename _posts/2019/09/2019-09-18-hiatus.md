It appears like we've taken an unintentional hiatus, doesn't it?  
We've both had slightly busy lives, and we've been spending our free time playing _Minecraft_ together.  
Speaking for myself, its been summer here, and during the summer I vastly prefer spending time outside on projects than inside on computer projects. But as I write this we're nearing the official start of fall, so we can rest assured I will be writing more again soon.  
I've been finishing my deck, hiking with family and friends, and generally getting refreshed over summer break. But I also have lots of ideas chasing each other around my head that I can't wait to explore further here.  
One more thing: I've created [logangee.net](logangee.net). For now I'm using it to host my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), some of my recipes, information about various projects, and some [art](https://logangee.net/images/smaller-buffalo.png). Less polished thoughts may go there too before eventually finding their way here.
