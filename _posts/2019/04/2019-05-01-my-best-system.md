summary: An exploration of the calendars my wife and I have used to manage our life for the past 5 years.

I hope it is apparent that I really like fiddling with my technology and the systems in my life. I tell myself I'll stop when I find the perfect system. This is the story of the only time I've actually stopped.  

I've had an iPhone since 2013, and it is the right choice for me for boring reasons that are out of the scope of this post. But way back in 2015, my (now) wife had just given up her Samsung Galaxy for an iPhone and we had opened an iCloud family for convenience. Being young 20-somethings, we were both pretty busy with work and seeing friends and family, and despite living together we could never seem to remember who was supposed to be where and when.  
I don't remember if I came up with it[^1], or if I heard about it somewhere, but I decided we should set up a series of shared calendars. These calendars have remained unchanged ever since. There are some downsides of our setup, which I will talk about later, but for anyone in a serious relationship I cannot recommend doing this more.  
## So whats the system?
1. Make 4 calendars: One for yourself, one for your partner, one for both of you, and one for reference.
2. Share them with your partner.
3. When you have an event, add it to the appropriate calendar with as much detail as possible.

Done. For a little explanation, keep reading.[^2]

### 1: The Calendars
You each get a calendar. Your calendar is for the events that you _and only_ you need to be at. Your partners is the same for them. Now you know what you have scheduled, and you know if your partner has anything planned so you don't double book them. Nifty!  
The shared calendar is where things that you both have to be at go. Maybe it's a friends birthday party, or a flight, or date night.  
The reference calendar is where we put everything else. If either of our parents are out of town, it goes in reference. If we have house guests, it goes in reference. We put Broncos games in reference so we know when they're on and be sure they're recorded if we won't be home. We put things like pay days and days off work here. A family member says "O we don't actually have plans yet but your cousins graduation is on the 19th and we're doing a brunch the day before"? That goes in reference. You get the idea.

### 2: Sharing
Otherwise you can't both see or edit it, and there's no point. Any questions? Great.

### 3. Event Creation
This is just calendar best practices. Fill out all the fields you can. My bare minimum is:
- a concise, descriptive title
- location
- travel time
- accurate start[^3]
- accurate duration[^4]

I find if those are all filled out correctly, 95% of the time there are no issues. However it certainly doesn't hurt to throw more detail in the `Notes` or `URL` fields. Future you will thank you.

## Possible Issues
> Sharing 4 different calendars seems excessive.  

I find I actually prefer it this way, because in iCloud having separate calendars enables you to set different colors for each calendar. I know to generally ignore yellow (my wife's) and grey (reference), but red (shared) and green (mine) are things I need to be sure I'm ready for any given day.

> What about events that I don't want to share?

Sometimes I like to plan out my whole day in 30min increments[^5]. I also don't want to flood my wife with a dozen notifications of things she doesn't actually care about. Luckily this easy to solve. Have another[^6] calendar that isn't shared.[^7] Go crazy on this calendar, and your partner doesn't need to know. And if you realize something does need to be shared, it's generally pretty easy to switch which calendar an event is on.  
And just in case you don't already think I'm crazy: I do have a personal reference calendar for reference events my wife doesn't care about. 

## Conclusion, I Guess
Sometimes people ask me how our relationship has lasted so long.  
That's a lie. But people _do_ ask my wife. And when she lets me add my 2¢, they are the following:
1. Have an awesome wife.
2. COMMUNICATE.
3. Implement this shared calendar system.

[^1]: doubtful
[^2]: I promise I'll try to keep it short.
[^3]: Not 100% sure? Put 15 min earlier.
[^4]: Ours defaults to 1 hour. This is surprisingly inaccurate, and I find its best to just round up to the next ½ hour.
[^5]: another time
[^6]: Yes, I know.
[^7]: Purple for all of you who didn't ask.
