title: Thinking About Thinking About What to Do 
---
Lots of people use a whole variety of task management systems: Kanban, GTD, Agile [^1], Bullet Journal, and so on. 
I‚Äôve tried lots of these systems for my own use, both personal and to manage everything I need to get done at work. 
The results have been somewhat less than successful. 
I still haven‚Äôt quite figured out the right system *for me*[^2], but I have found a few things I need to pay particular attention to. 
 


## Tasks vs Projects
I‚Äôve found that one of the challenging keystones to getting stuff done is differentiating between a task and a project. 
It is far too easy to put a project into my system as a task, then never get around to doing it just because it seems like such a huge amount of work to do. 

A task should be something that be done quickly[^3] and in a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). 
Anything else is probably a combination of multiple tasks, and should go into the system as a project. 
 


## Manageable Goals and Limited Timescales
It really sucks to plan out the things you want to do this week, and find at the end of the week you haven‚Äôt been able to accomplish half of what you wanted. 
And that feeling is even worse if you scale it up to yearly resolutions[^4], or even long-term health, career, and personal goals. 

Luckily, there is a relatively well known remedy that I had to learn the hard way: expect less of yourself. 
Underpromise & overdeliver. 

I‚Äôve done this both by limiting how many goals I set myself, and forcing myself to think in smaller chunks of time. 
Each night, I look at my calendar for the next day, and pick tasks according to how much time and energy I have. 
If I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to get something done or not, I don‚Äôt plan on doing it that day. 
If I happen to find myself with extra time and energy, I will grab something off my task list and do it. 
But how to choose something off the list?? 
I‚Äôm glad you asked.[^5] I set myself up on cycles of life. 
Currently, I spend about six or seven weeks[^6] working on a given set of projects and tasks, then take a week *off* and spend that time planning my next round. 
Functionally, anything that is not something to do in my current cycle, I set as ‚ÄúSomeday‚Äù in my task manager, and it is effectively hidden. 
Then everything else is assigned an area and *one* tag out of a predetermined set. 
This makes it very easy to filter to what tasks I can do given where I am and what tools I have at my disposal. 
 


## Improvising and Failing
The last major thing I‚Äôve had to learn to embrace is to not be scared of adjusting my plan, or even of *gasp* üò± failure. 
Life happens. 
Maybe you something goes wrong, and you end up not being able to spend Tuesday writing and posting[^7]. 
Every night, before I plan the next day, I like what I did and ‚Äî more importantly ‚Äî didn‚Äôt get done. 
The things I didn‚Äôt get done either get scheduled for another day, thrown back into the bucket, or deleted. 
Yeah, it sucks to think you missed an opportunity, but sometime the best choice is to accept a failure and move on. 
If something important or special comes up in real life, its best to set aside your ideal plan and just *live*. 


Speaking of which‚Ä¶ its a Saturday morning and the weather outside looks beautiful. 
Maybe next time I will write about the my distaste of the GTD inbox, my complicated relationship with personal reviews, and/or journalling. 
 


But, Alex and I also have some ~~big~~[^8] plans for posts in the future, so stay tuned for that!!

[^1]:See Alex‚Äôs [fascinating](https://hencefarthing.blog/2018/01/08/IPB-S1W1/) [posts](https://hencefarthing.blog/2018/01/15/IPB-S1W2/) on this topic ‚Äî I‚Äôm learning quite a bit about a system I never fully grasped before. 
 

[^2]:Task managers are an area where taste varies wildly and what works for one person almost certainly will not work for anyone else. 
 

[^3]:Definitely less than an hour, ideally less than half an hour. 
 

[^4]:more on that another time
[^5]:You‚Äôre welcome, me.

[^8]:Normal sized. Maybe even small.
