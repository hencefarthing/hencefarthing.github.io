Time for another review! This month I'm reviewing a little smartphone game called [Mr. Gun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.mrgun&hl=en). I say it's "little" because it doesn't take any time to get set up and to start playing, and there's only a few real "tricks" to the game. I'd also like to defined the game as ["Hypercasual"](https://blog.applovin.com/hyper-casual-mobile-gamings-newest-genre/), but mostly only because I recently learned the term, not because I totally understand the definition (if there even is an official definition out there).

The goal of the game is to tap the screen at the perfect time for your character to shoot other AI characters above you. There are two main "groups" of AI characters:
1. Basic characters
    - These characters are beaten with one shot, anywhere on their body. If you hit them in the head, you get double points AND a coin or two (the coins can be used to purchase new outfits or guns).
1. Boss characters
    - These characters have more HP (hit points), so you need to shoot them more than once to take them down. A headshot hurts them twice as much, but earn you no extra coins. After defeating a boss, you will earn a random amount of coins, between 3 and 5 (inclusive).

Part of the appeal of this game is its "hypercasual" nature. I played this game right before bed, on my way to work, in the metro, sitting on the toilet, and even while at work (don't tell my boss!). It only takes one finger to fire a bullet, and you only have to pay attention for a few seconds at a time. These are great qualities for a hypercasual game, but didn't satisfy me long-term. Maybe it's not possible for me to be satisfied by the same hypercasual game for a long time, or maybe the game needs a few adjustments before it's "perfect". Here's a screenshot showing my favorite costume, my high score, and the farthest level I reached:

# This month's review

Here's the review I left on Google Play Games. I wanted to leave the impression that this game is fun but gets a bit repetitive, which is why I ended up giving the game 4 out of 5 stars.

    If you're looking for a short-lived game that doesn't take much brain power and can keep your attention for a few weeks, download this game! The colors are mesmerizing, the gameplay is simple but fun, and the large number of costumes and gun types will keep you wanting to collect them all! This game was a perfect time waster for a couple of weeks, but once you get past Level 200, you realize the game doesn't change much and neither should your strategy. I stuck with it till level 501 (to earn one specific costume), but at that point I didn't think another 500 repetitive levels were worth my time. To get the fifth star, I think the game will need to either make me try a bit harder to win levels, or finish their future plans for explodey and / or upgradable guns.

That's the review! Check out the game [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.mrgun&hl=en) if you're interested in testing how accurate my review was :)

# Improve, please?

As promised, I have a few ideas for how this game could be improved to hold my interest for longer than 3 weeks. I'm serious about how this game was super fun initially! But yeah... It needs some improvements to stay relevant. Here are some of my ideas:

1. Make the game get progressively harder. How? Here are some ideas:
    - Give bosses progressively more HP.
        - As far as I could tell, all bosses from level 200 - 500 had the exact same amount of HP. This doesn't make me care to try hard to pass more levels because it's not showing I'm "good" at the game. Instead, it just shows I have lots of time to kill ðŸ˜²
    - Make basic AI characters move around a bit.
        - After 500 levels of basic AI characters jumping in front of your gun, standing still, waiting to be shot, you would think they would have a bit more "intelligence".
1. Make new level "types" every 50 or 100 levels.
    - Speed round
        - How many basic AI characters can you kill in 1 minute?
    - Mega Boss
        - Bosses have 5 - 10 times the normal HP
    - Multiple targets
1. Make more interesting challenges for more rewards.
    - 10, 25, 50... headshots in a row
    - 25, 50, 100... shots without misses
    - 5, 20, 100... levels completed in one day

The game does have a few "coming soon" screens which potentially would have kept me interested longer while I was initially playing the game. For example, they mention that there will be some "explodey" guns (they even show a silhouette of an RPG), and some even cooler outfits. I seem to even remember a screen hinting that eventually guns may be upgradable. However, at this point I've sunk too much time into the relatively bland initial version of the game, so I am unlikely to jump back into the game in the future, even if it gets the aforementioned updates.

# 'Till next time

That's all I have this time! If you do end up downloading and playing this game (**Logan**), please let me know what you think, in regards to 1) my review above, 2) the ways the game could be improved, and 3) anything else you want to add.

Thanks for reading :)
