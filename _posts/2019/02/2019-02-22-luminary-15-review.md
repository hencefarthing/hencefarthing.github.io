This review was initially posted on the [Tom Bihn forums.][1]

In this version of the review I have omitted some of the basics, which are covered on the product page, or in the other great reviews in the forums. I have not tried a pantheon of Tom Bihn bags like many of the members of the forums, partially because of a small bag budget and partially because I tend to only buy something if I am >90% certain it is right for me after hours of extensive research (aerospace engineers are the worst). As such, I will also not be comparing the Luminary to any other bags, but rather detailing why I was counting the days until I could buy one, and what my impressions are now that I've used it for a week.  
I would also like to start by thanking Kat and the rest of the Tom Bihn crew for arranging for review units to be sent to forum members. That is an incredibly awesome gesture and it really goes to show what a quality company this is. Not to mention the fact that they were willing to delay a long-awaited launch to ensure their employees safety in dangerous winter weather. I wish more companies and people in the world were like this!
## My Road to the Luminary 15
My first Tom Bihn bag was a [Pilot][2] a few years ago, and boy did I love it. It was just about perfect in every way and had a couple features I instantly wished all bags had: the center mounted water bottle pocket and the cache laptop storage system. (As an aerospace engineer I spend _lots_ of time thinking about centers of gravity, and yet I'd never applied it to bags I carried before). After more use and seeing how the bag held up, handled every day life, and adapted to virtually any scenario.  
So naturally, when we began planning our honeymoon and realized we didn't have any luggage, I knew where to look. An [Aeronaut 45][3] joined the family, followed quickly by the [A30][4]. These have been our go-to travel bags and accompanied us on many great adventures.  
But times change, and eventually I found two issues with the Pilot: I wasn't using the laptop cache feature as much, and I needed a backpack to evenly distribute weight and help resolve some ongoing back issues I've had. Of course I turned to Tom Bihn.  
I'm ~6'2"-6'3" (depends how recently I've done my back exercises), so I knew I'd need something designed for a larger frame. But I also know myself well enough to know that if I have a big bag, I _will_ overfill it, which is just as much of a problem. The Synapses looked promising, but seemed like they would awaken my inner over-packing demons. The Luminary looked perfect, but I worried about it looking like a child's bag on my larger frame.  
I waffled and waffled, and even got as far as adding the smaller [Luminary][5] to my shopping cart before seeing that they would be releasing a larger one soon (at that time called the Luminary 14), so I decided to wait it out. I checked back regulary, occasionally added the old Luminary to my cart before wimping out again, read the forums constantly (I've never been much of a poster on anything, but I read constantly), and begrudgingly used a North Face Recon that my uncle had given me as a gift.  
## Priorities and Use Cases
Since I first started looking for a backpack, I put a lot of thought into what I want in a bag. (Too much? Maybe. But these forums are a safe space). So here are the requirements I came up with:
1. I wanted a backpack that had a center mounted water bottle pocket; I often carry a 40 oz water bottle, and if it is off center I might as well just have a shoulder bag. 
2. I wanted something not too large so I couldn't overpack it, but also big enough that it didn't look ridiculous on my relatively large frame. 
3. I wanted something that could be my go-to bag for everything: work, class, the gym, hiking, bike rides, going to town with friends, etc. And my wife had very clearly disallowed anything resembling a man purse.
4. I wanted something with limited built in organization, but lots of options for add-on expansion. From the Pilot and Aeronauts, I  learned that I love the Tom Bihn style of organization: when you don't need much the bag stays out of the way, but when you need to do more it supports whatever caches or packing cubes you want.  

Only one bag looked like it would fit all of these requirements: the upcoming larger Luminary. So I kept neurotically checking every part of the website, wallet in hand.
## Description of the Bag
In terms of overall dimensions, the Luminary is a bit longer than the Pilot, although much more streamlined and sleek looking. But as a backpack, it is actually small; I can fit it, fully packed, inside the North Face bag I have been using.

I opted for the Nebulous Grey/Island variant and I have to say it is a great looking backpack. I've always been a fan of the pop of color on the inside of Tom Bihn bags, which contrasts nicely with a more professional exterior color. If you don't know any more details of the bag, I highly recommend looking at the [product page][6], but a quick summary:
- One large main pocket with a zip away water bottle holder in the center and a small pocket near the top
- Two zipped side pockets
- One padded back pocket with a side access zipper  

The zippers of this bag are very elegantly designed: the large pocket and two side pockets are in-line while the back pocket zipper is tucked along a seem; at first glance this gives the bag the impression of only having one zipper. (The blog post announcing the bag clarifies: it is one zipper, but with 3 pulls attached. Very impressive design skills.)  
Overall this bag looks very professional and elegant, while also packing in enough pockets to provide ample organization.
## Does this Luminary Meet My Requirements?
1. Center mounted water bottle pocket: ☑️ The ability to attach/detach it also adds an extra bit of utility in cases where I might have something large and flat I want to slide into that pocket at some point (more on that later)
2. Not large enough that over packing is a concern: ☑️ I've spent the last week experimenting with how much it can hold comfortably. The biggest stress was probably on Tuesday: temperatures were ~20°F leading me to pack hat and gloves, and I had class right afterwork so I needed to carry 12 hours worth of meals & snacks, along with my water bottle and a tea cup. This bag has been able to fit enough for any single day/activity. I'll go through my examples with pictures shortly.
3. Not so small it looks ridiculous on someone my size: I think so, but I'll let you be the judge of that: as previously mentioned, when the tightness in my back allows me to stand up straight I'm 6'3", so I feel comfortable recommending this bag to taller individuals. Here's a couple pictures of me wearing it while loaded. ![Bag Fit](/images/luminary15/fit.JPG)
4. Organization: 90% there, it'll probably be all the way once I buy a Q-Kit for the top portion of the bag. I've settled into this organization:
	- Right pocket: phone & sunglasses
	- Left pocket: wallet, keys, headphones, a pen
	- Padded compartment: 11" iPad and any papers I happen to have (I avoid using paper because I **always** lose or destroy it. In the rare circumstances I have a sheet or two, keeping them near the iPad prevent crumpling and crinkling)
	- Small Interior pocket: "emergency" fruit bars & protein bars
	- Large pocket: whatever it is I need for that day/outing
## Use Cases
Now here are some pictures of use cases I've experimented with in the last week. In all these shots, the right and left pockets are filled as described above.
A note for all these pictures: my phone is not in the bag or the contents because, well, I needed it to take pictures with. It is the iPhone XS Max, and fits in the right pocket with my sunglasses easily, unless there is something especially bulky and stiff behind that pocket.
1. Lets start with what the bag looked like when I got home from work today: 40 oz water bottle, 11" iPad, the remains of my lunch, sunglasses, hat and gloves (it warmed up a lot during the day). The 3D Organizer Cube is the same one I use as a 3-1-1 bag for travel, just with things I may need on any given day: chap stick, tissues, hand sanitizer, and deodorant. ![Work Today](/images/luminary15/work.JPEG)
2. Here's what I imagine taking on a typical day to town or a coffee shop or a day I pack my lunch into a separate bag: similar to today, minus tupperwares and plus a light jacket and a hat  (note: I forgot to take the iPad out for the "everything taken out" shot) ![](/images/luminary15/basic.JPG)
3. Gym bag: water, workout clothes, and my gym shoes. I was honestly shocked the bag fit my gym shoes, especially with room for anything else. I wear 13s or 14s and they barely felt like they fit in my old 30L North Face bag. Note: I've used this when I go to the gym from home. If I am using the gym at work, I still tend to take a separate gym bag so I can leave it in the locker all day. ![Gym bag](/images/luminary15/gym.JPEG)
4. Tennis bag (this is still hypothetical, I haven't had much time to play since summer): Two racquets, old hat, towel, two water bottles (40 oz & 18 oz). The only thing that doesn't fit is my tennis shoes and/or a can of tennis balls. However my tennis shoes can smell pretty gnarly and I only need a can for ~25% of matches. But for a match or longer practice I probably would still rather use my tennis bag to accommodate more hydration, snacks, and layers. But it is nice to know this bag will work for a quick hitting session or for Cardio Tennis. ![tennis](/images/luminary15/tennis.JPG)

## Miscellany
- For science, I tried to fit my Nintendo Switch into the side pocket and I am happy to report that it does fit! The JoyCons need to be removed from the sides and put in after the main console. This is not a big deal, but nice to know that it fits in case I want to take it on a plane ride or to a family gathering. ![just barely!](/images/luminary15/switch.JPG)
- The two side zippers are slightly different heights: this is nice for fitting different things into different compartments. I have noticed one slight drawback, although it may be specific to me and my currently-limited mobility: the right zipper is a bit too high to unzip while wearing it. This doesn't present much of a problem, as I pull my phone out while walking far less frequently than I do my car keys.
- I never intended to carry the 40oz water bottle in this bag, but when I saw how handily it fit, I immediately changed my mind. You can see the outline in the bag a little bit, but I can easily drink that much water in a day and the larger water bottle helps the bag stand upright unsupported.

## Summary
I had high expectations of this bag, especially given that all I had seen was its smaller sibling. But despite that, I am impressed with the Luminary 15 and think it is perfect for 90% of my situations.  The few areas it falls down are areas it was never designed for (i.e. a tennis bag or multi-day bag).   
If you are looking for a large bag to carry gym clothes, a laptop, and food for a full day, you may want to look elsewhere. But, if you are looking for a bag to carry just the bare necessities for a few hours or a day, this is the right bag. Its been too snowy to hike much lately, but I expect in summer it will get a fair bit of use on the trail for day hikes. If you are like me and like to have separate gym and work bags, this is also a perfect choice.  

When my wife got home from work the day I received my review unit, she was prepared to tease me endlessly for how excited I was. But by the time we got to the gym, she had stopped teasing and actually said how nice a bag it is. By the time we got home from the gym, she said that she wanted one of her own. 

And, because all bags must be investigated by our cats, Cheeto has done his own review of it as a meditation cushion: ![oohhmmmmmmmmm](/images/luminary15/cheeto2.JPG)
