As mysteriously as they arrived in early June 2016, they recently left in April 2019, for where? Home?

There are so many questions unanswered. Will they return? Will they miss this place? Will they think of the friends and family they left behind?

Of course, I know they left part of their hearts and souls behind in this place. Their presence will forever be felt in the hot and crowded metro, the bumpy and trash-filled streets, the empty and lifeless living room.

During previous absenses, I rejoiced in the calm and peaceful atmophere. But this time is different. This time, I can feel an emptiness inside.

They're not coming back...
