Some days wind blow ice, snow, and sleet at 65 mph. Some days the power goes out. Some nights you stay up reading trivial pursuit cards by the firelight. Some nights the house gets down to 55Â°F. Some nights a smoke detector dies and you have to get out of the warm bed and fix it.\
But when the power comes on the next morning and you start to warm back up, you never appreciate modern life more.\
