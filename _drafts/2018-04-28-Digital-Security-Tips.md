In the past week (from the day I started this post) two of my friends told me about three security risks. Not about some doofus who never sets passwords on anything, not about a naive tech user whose passwords are all '123'... but situations that could have been avoided if people were properly prepared. I have to be honest, I like to think of myself as smart with tech and security, but I don't know what I would do in these situations. Anyway, here are the events and some resources I found that *could* and / or *should* help prevent them happening to you:

# Lost phone w/ naked photos of you and your lover on your phone

# Facebook account getting hacked & potentially embarrassing photos accessed

3. Password & Associated Email Address Changed
  - Recover using Mobile Number
    - Go to Facebook Forgot Password option
    - Enter your mobile number in the text box and click search.
    - You should see your profile with recovery email address and mobile number if any. Select mobile number or email address that you can access right now and then click Continue.
    - Select your mobile number and then click Continue.
    - Check your mobile inbox for recovery code and enter the recovered code in the given text box.
    - That’s all. Set your new password of your Facebook account.
  - Recover using Email Change Notification
    - **Note:** (according to the article) This method can be applied only if you try in few days after your account was hacked.
    - Login to your email account (email that you have given on Facebook) and search for emails from Facebook about the change of email address. Usually, that email subject would be “Facebook primary email changed to”.
    - Click “If you didn’t do this, please secure your account.” link in that email.
    - You will be prompted to “Secure your account“, click continue to proceed.
    - In next step, there might be a variety of recovery options given depending upon your account and security.
      - Upload an ID: You should upload a government ID through the given steps. A Facebook representative will verify it and activate your account and also will notify about it in email
      - Verify your Date of Birth: You should enter your date of birth to proceed to your Facebook account.
      - Guess your friends using their photos: You need to select 5 friends name out of 7 by seeing their photos.

# Other tips:
If someone hacks any account of yours, one of the FIRST things you should do: **CHANGE ALL OF YOUR PASSWORDS ON OTHER ONLINE ACCOUNTS** - especially if any other account uses the same password that got hacked!! When I was in high school and maybe the first year or two of college, I used the same simple password for all of my accounts, and eventually I got smart after a few smart people warned me that if ANY account got hacked (or if someone saw me entering my password), ALL of my accounts would be compromised instantly.
