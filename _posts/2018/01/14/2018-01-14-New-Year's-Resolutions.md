New Year’s Resolutions are the butt of every joke and seemingly doomed to fail. Last year I decided I would post a picture on Instagram every day to help me practice photography and get better at it. That lasted exactly 2 weeks.

So this year, I made several New Year’s resolutions which are just “be more aware of *X* this year” or “think about it a bit more before you do *Y*”. Those all seem just vague enough to fail.

But one that is measurable was writing more. And luckily I was able to convince my (much more interesting) BFF across the world to participate. So here we are! Welcome to Hencefarthing!  

We’re not quite sure what this blog will be about, or what we want it to become, we just want to have somewhere to put our ideas and to share them. We both plan to post ~once per week and share our thoughts on *something*. My partner in nonsense has some good thoughts to post about the really wonderful work he is doing in Cairo, and I have a couple half-baked ideas — ironically about finishing what you start and baking — that I hope to be posting in the coming weeks.
