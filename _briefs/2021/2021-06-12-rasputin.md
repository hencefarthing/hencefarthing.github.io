My cat's name is Rasputin.

The previous sentence, although quite staightforward and bland, has two big flaws with some interesting [^1] backstory.

## "My cat"

First, "the cat" (he's a he) isn't mine. He's also not Dina's. His mom was a stray, living on nearby streets in Tagamo3 (New Cairo) when we saw her for the first time. She was pregnant, so of course Dina had to be loving and care for her. We fed her milk and chicken bones whenever she came by our door, and she eventually had 5 beautiful baby kittens. We named the cats - One of these was Rasputin.

## Rasputin

[^1]: HEY LOGAN! YES this is interesting. Don't start talking about how your pinky toe has a more entertaining backstory CUZ IT DOESN'T.
