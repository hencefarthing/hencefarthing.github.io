I’ve often read & heard that the key to being a successful writer is to just write, and rely on practice makes perfect. And sometimes, when you don’t have any idea what to write, just start writing anyway. When Alex and I agreed to have a post done by Tuesday, I had no idea what I would write about. Tuesday is now six and a half hours away 😅 [^in my timezone of course, Alex is already there], so I better fallback to the timeless advice of start writing anyway.  
However, while studiously ignoring both pieces of advice mentioned above, I stumbled across an short story I wrote from a couple years ago — one of the few older writing I have that I am still rather proud of. I thought it might be fun to reread it[^in a slightly edited form, some of my stylistic preferences have changed], and comment on some areas I did well, what needs to be improved, and areas that I find interesting for some reason. So without further ado, here is the story:  

## Man’s Head Explodes in Barber’s Chair
The cops don’t believe me. They’ve taken my blood splattered apron and my testimony but they think I’m crazy. Sure I had a record, but that was twenty years ago. I’m cleaned up. I’m a barber. I help people freshen up. I never wanted to see blood again. John’s head blew up. What was I to do? Right as I started trimming his sideburns... just... SPLAT! We were discussing his daughters’ upcoming ballet performance. This week is the yearly rendition of The Nutcracker and his daughters are cast as the Rat King and the Nutcracker himself. I’m not that interested by ballet, but John was thrilled about it so we were both very cheerful. . His family life sounds nice, although he sure is busy. John says the only time he gets to relax is during his weekly haircut. He’s been a great customer all these years. Since the day he walked in barely a week has gone by without him getting a trim in my chair. I would even say he’s my friend, not just a customer. Of course the cops don’t believe it.  

The tall officer who needs to shave just glares at me and says I’ll get what I de- serve. He keeps calling me a sick bastard. His partner, a shortish chubby fellow with a magnificent moustache, is just looking at me sadly. It’s the exact same look Maggie used to give me when she was disappointed in me. Damn I miss her. I haven’t thought of her in years. I still remember how her chocolate colored eyes seemed to smile back at me when she awoke each morning. But that was when I was young. Her sad gaze that last night still haunts me across two decades. Now a new cop walks in. She’s an older woman, golden and silver hairs braided together. She studies me carefully while walking slowly to the table. Her cool blue eyes seem to be gazing into my very soul.  

She apologized for the other officers’ behavior, says that Simmons has always had a temper. That must be the taller fellow.  

“It’s been a long time since you’ve given us any trouble”. I guess it has been. Last time I sat in this cold metal chair had been different. I was guilty then, and full of re- gret. An older gentleman had thanked me for my cooperation and informed me that I would be getting a deal. Not that I’d cared then. I thought my life was over.  

“It says here that your information helped capture Giordano. You were done with crime. You looked like a broken man. What changed?” Now I remember those pierc- ing blue eyes. She was in training back then. She was the assistant who helped get my testimony.  

“I avoid trouble ma’am. I seen enough blood back then. You remember what hap- pened. What I lost. I just want peace. Freshen people up. Give ‘em a clean shave and a nice cut.” Maggie had always said you can tell a man by how he was trimmed. She hated when I had a beard. Told me to clean up my face and my life. She’d been right in the end. But that didn’t matter now. All that matters is what Officer Lawson is telling me.  

“...don’t trust you. They say you’re still the man you were twenty years ago. But I’m their superior officer and in the end I decide if we charge you with a crime. Tell me again what happened to Mr. Honeywell.” So I tell her again what I’d already told Officers Scruffy and Chubby. I gave John a haircut every Saturday morning. Sometimes we talked about solving the world’s problems, sometimes we told jokes. He always talked about his family. Even while telling her I have to wonder what my family could have been like. Maybe I’d have daughters in The Nutcracker this year. And I’d be a clean cut father, just what Maggie would’ve wanted. “...just as I was leveling out his left sideburn John yelled slightly and his head just... just exploded. I called nine one one right away.”  

“Why did his head blow up Mr. Sommers?”  

“I don’t know. My mind was elsewhere. It just blew up.”  

“You really do miss her don’t you? Even after all these years?”  

Those blue eyes stare into my soul. I can’t say anything. Just nod slightly. “She tried to come in and give us information you know? We were going to put her in wit- ness protection, but she wanted to ask you to join her. I’m sorry. If you want to grab coffee later I can tell you more about the case.”  

“It looks like I’m booked tonight, but that’s a kind offer.”  

“You’re free to go Mr. Sommers. Maggie would have liked to know you cleaned up. And that you help others do the same.”  

## 👍🏼 The Good  
### The Title  
I’m not sure how much credit I can really take for the title — this story was born from a challenge to write a story based solely on a bizarre/paranormal headline from a tabloid. I don’t even think I can take credit for which headline, as I recall it being drawn out of a hat. Nonetheless, I do quite enjoy the title, and it makes me chuckle a bit every time I see it.  
### The Normalcy of the Story  
It’s titled *Man’s Head Explodes in Barber’s Chair* and yet I barely mention the exploding head. In truth, this is yet another fumble that turned out well for me. For the life of me, I could not come up with a way to incorporate the exploding head without going completely off the rails. Combine that with the fact that I was trying to keep the story short, and I decided just to treat it like something that just happened and not explain it whatsoever. I am happy with the way it turned out though, because then all the attention[^both mine & the readers] turns to the story being told and the interactions between the people.  
### The Focus On the Now  
As a reader of this, I really enjoy the “Show don’t tell” that I managed to pull off. It makes the world feel more real, because what kind of narrator thinks to themselves the intricate details of something that happened 20 years ago?  
### Humor  
“It looks like I’m booked tonight” 🤣 — I crack me up.  
“Officers Scruffy and Chubby”  🙃
## 👎🏼 The Bad  
Enough tooting my own horn. Lets look at some of the things I don’t like.  
### The Gangster’s Name
‘Giordano’‽ What is this, a frozen pizza gang? Unimaginative at best. But, can’t win them all. The rest of the names are pretty bad too. But this is in a class of it’s own.  
### Continuity
Yeah, its a single scene story, but I still managed to create continuity errors. That’s pretty impressive in a way. But not a good way.  
Why did the narrator change? The story implies a huge and sudden flip, that feels like would not be convincing if we heard the whole story. The best explanation I can come up with is only one notch above George Lucas’ “turned evil because of love” story we got to explore in Episode III.  
Why hadn’t he met this detective in the last two decades? *Surely* someone must’ve been in contact with him. How does she remember him and not the other way around?  
## 🤔 The Interesting
### The Real-Life Inspiration  
It is pretty fascinating to look and see what things were obviously (to me) inspired by my own life: The Nutcracker, the character descriptions[^the chocolate colored eyes and the silver and gold braids], the flow of the narrator’s train of thought… I also can’t help but wonder if these details stand out to someone reading it for the first time or who doesn’t know me. They stick out to me, but then again I know what’s behind the curtain.
