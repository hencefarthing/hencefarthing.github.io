Guess what I learned today! If I get on your computer and log in to your Gmail account, I can get a copy of every email you send 😈 (_to yourself_)

How do I do this?

1. Open Gmail settings
1. Add a _Forwarding Address_ (the email address you want everything sent to)
    - Confirm the forwarding address
1. Confirm allowing emails to be fowarded to your personal address (check your person email)
    - You may have to confirm _again_
1. Create a filter on your friend's account
    - From `"me"`
    - Click "Create Filter"
    - Forward it to: `<your person address>`
    - Click "Create Filter"

Now you're done! Happy reading!

_P.S. I hoped this would work for ALL emails sent from your account, but I haven't figured that one out yet. 🤷‍♀️ Let me know if you do! (**COUGH** Logan **COUGH**)_
