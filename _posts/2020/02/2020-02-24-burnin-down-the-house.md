Wait, is this a post about Alex's childhood or about the Talking Head's 1983 song ["Burning Down the House?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U)?? OR WAIT, MAYBE BOTH??

Ok in all seriousness, this isn't really a laughing matter... This post is literally about burning down a house!

On January 15th 2020, my apartment in Maadi, Cairo caught on fire.

Say **whaaaaaat!?** Fire?? üî•*like REAL* Fire!!!??? üî•

Yes indeed... Let's begin :)

## How the Blazes...

January 15th started out like many other Wednesdays of the past year. I left my apartment early, prepared to give a training on Google Sheets and how spreadsheets can be used for effective Electronic Case Management.

> This training is one of the I.T. [^1] trainings my colleagues and I have been providing to Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in order to raise their technical capabilities. The goal is to raise them to a minimum technical proficiency where they would be able to benefit from using a professional Case Management System. Obviously this hasn't been the _only_ training in that package; there are many others on topics such as Windows 10 Basics, Microsoft Word, Typing, Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, and more. CBOs must complete this package of trainings before they are able to use the case management system I've been creating the past year.

Anyway, back to the good stuff! üî•ü§™

Immediately following my 3-hour training, I was relaxing and enjoying my lunch [^2]. I had just started chowing down on my delicious Syrian shwarma sandwich, when I got a call from my landlady. My landlady was an incredibly sweet, older lady named Naglaa. She was my next-door neighbor, and she was always there for me and my family whenever we needed her [^3]. Naglaa almost **never** called me in the middle of a work day... So I had a hunch something was fishy.

When I answered the call, I didn't recognize the voice on the other end of the line at first. It wasn't my landlady, it was her niece - with whom I had only spoken a few times in the past. She seemed like she had to talk about something pretty serious, but she proceeded in a relatively slightly manner. She said...

> Hello, this is Alex, right? How are you doing? Sorry to disturb you. Your apartment caught on fire, everything was destroyed. The police are here and I need some information from you, can you tell me your job and place of employment?

üò≥

After I confirmed she was on the phone with the correct Alex (me!), I was flabbergasted... _"My apartment what?"_, _"**Everything** everything is destroyed??"_, _"What should I do???"_, _"**Just** my job and place of employment????"_ These were the only questions I could eek out after hearing the terrible news.

I answered my landlady's niece and she said thanks, she would be in touch. _"That's it?? What should I do now?"_, I asked. _"Should I come back right away?"_, _"What can I do?"_. She told me there's nothing really that could be done at this point. Firemen had already put out the fire and police had already written up their report. At my convenience, I should come see what happened and collect the surviving items.

Dilemma time... Remember how I mentioned earlier _"I had just started chowing down on my delicious Syrian shawerma sandwich"_? This new development successfully ruined my appetite. But I knew I'd be hungry later... And it seemed there wasn't an immediate rush to get back to my apartment... So I ate in silence. Thinking. _Was that phone call real?_ _Is there actually "**Nothing** left?"_ _What caused the fire?_ _Am I going to have to pay for everything?_ _Did anyone get hurt?_ Obviously I wouldn't have answers until I saw everything in person...

> Small side note: My plan for the day _was_ to finish the training, then head to another office for a meeting. Luckily, one person who would attend the meeting was with me in my training that morning, so I briefly explained the situation to him, and he quickly and humbly offered any help he could. He gave me 200 egp (with no expectation of getting it back) and he offered to run the meeting himself, as he insisted I should go to my apartment right away to figure out what happened. At this moment I started realizing how amazingly lucky I was, being surrounded with many loving and caring people. More on this later...

After lunch, I left for my home. First, I sent a voice message to my lovely Dina, briefly explaining the situation and that I'd provide more details when I got home. Second, I texted my roommate. Although the cause of the fire was not completely known, my landlady's niece had mentioned that a heater possibly was left on while we were at work, and the only heater in our apartment was located in his room [^4]. Finally, I sent a quick text to my boss mentioning I was going to take off work for the day because my apartment caught fire (subtle, right?). Then I stood on the metro in silence. The chaos of Cairo seemed to melt away as my subconscious kept asking those questions on repeat... _"Nothing left?"_, _"What caused the fire?"_, _"Did anyone get hurt?"_, _"What should I do next?"..._

## The Aftermath

Once I arrived at the metro station by my house, I called my roommate and we met outside the apartment [^5]. The main gate was open and we could see a trail of ash and footprints all the way up the staircase. On the second floor, the residents had their front door open, and they looked at us and shamefully shook their head as we ascended toward our smouldering abode.

We arrived at the doorstep to our apartment and the initial view was shocking. The ceiling was black and some chunks had fallen to the floor, and the rest of the room was white from fire extinguisher residue and ash. Looking around the living room, I felt a combination of distress and relief. _Thank goodness, not everything was destroyed._

First we checked out my roommate's bedroom... My landlady's niece's voice came to my head - `"Everything was destroyed"`. The only recognizable item was the metal heater that may have started this whole mess. The old matress? _Disintegrated_. The dresser and cabinent? _Burnt to crisps_. The bedside table? _Gone_. My roommate was literally left with _nothing_. By the time we arrived, there were some guys literally digging up the floor in the room. The walls were falling apart and even floorboards had burned up.

<img src="/images/apt-fire/roommate-4.jpg" alt="roommate room 4" width="50%" style="float: left;border: 2px solid transparent;" />

At this point, I was scared to see what happened in my room...

My room was across the hall and luckily <prayer hands> I had closed my door in the morning, so the fire had spent much less time partying in my room. The fire got into my room by bursting through the frosted-glass pane on my door. From there, it seems like it had quickly made its way to the ceiling where it destroyed the AC unit, caused a few little cave-ins, and knocked a few pictures off the wall. Luckily üôè, almost nothing of mine was destroyed. My passport had been sitting on my dresser, but one of the pictures had fallen on it, protecting it from heat. All of my cash was safe in my bedside table. My clothes had chunks of ceiling and wall scattered through them (and yeah, even to this day some smell like smoke), but 99% remained unscathed. _I got so lucky..._

## The Exit

After inspecting the apartment, I literally was at a loss for what I should do next. So I asked my landlady. She calmly asked me to pack up all of my belongings, sign the contract ending our professional relationship, and go [^6]. So that's where we began.

Dina, my lovey Dina, was already on her way to my apartment. She heard my voice message and immediately left her work, not even asking me if I needed help or if her boss would suffer from her absense. I loved that so much.

I also had called some friends from work, asking if they could bring some trash bags where I could collect my stinky clothes. They quickly came over and helped carry my shenanigans down the stairs and outside my apartment.

Once we moved everything out, I signed a statement on my contract which read: _"Resident ended contract after causing a fire in the flat by misuse of an electric heater"_. Then we were asked to leave. At this point, I expected to hear, _"Oh, and you owe us \$100,000 for the apartment you just burned down!"_ But surprisingly, my roommate and I calmly returned the keys, took my stuff outside, and we were done!

> According to Dina, in order to sublet your flat in Cairo, you have to have permission from the government. This obviously involves paying some tax, so some families skip this process (sneakily) to save a bit more money. We believe this is why my roommate and I were not liable for damages or any further after the fire. I absolutely considered us so lucky, but this also left a big lump of guilt in my heart - leaving the burden of reparation to the kind-hearted, sweet family of my landlady.

## What Next?

After we moved all of my stuff to a secure storage cabinet at my office, it was time to figure out... What next?

Dina, my super travel expert, quickly helped me find an affortable, nearby AirBNB to rent. I booked the place for 2 weeks so I could take my time finding a suitable, long-term place to live. Dina stuck around for a while that night, keeping me company as my head continuously replayed the events of the day. She drove me to a store to pick up some snacks and necessary items for the night, she helped me move my essentials into the AirBNB, then she went home and I tried to relax and sleep.

The next night I was at my weekly frisbee team training, and I told my team what happened [^7]. I tried not to sound desperate for a place to stay, and to my surprise I quickly received 3 offers for rooms I could stay in! I gave everyone a week to think about it, and luckily my teammate Chase was still up for getting a new roommie after the week ended.

Now I'm living with Chase and his lady, not too far from the office (see map at the bottom of the page), with my own room and my own bathroom (with a shower)! They're a super chill and friendly couple, about to get married in Mexico. I couldn't be more lucky.

## Post-Narr Analysis

_Note: In Arabic, Narr means fire üî• ;)_

We're now about a month after the fire, and I've been doing some thinking. I want to mention 2 important things that became quite clear to me during this mini disaster:

_First: I really feel the love._

I absolutely can't thank _everyone_ enough, as there was so much support from so many different people. I'm the kind of person who doesn't often ask for help, but that didn't stop many people from coming to my rescue. I'd really love express my sincere gratitude toward these people:

-   ‚ù§ Dina ‚ù§
    -   She left her work to immediately come assist, without asking for permission or talking to her boss. She found a cheap, nearby AirBNB when I didn't know where to look, and she helped organize my essentials into a suitcase to take there. She even happily stored a few of my things in her car after the fire, despite knowing it would stink it up a bit.
    -   I can go on, but it may appear I have a favorite ;)
-   Salem
    -   He _immediately_ gave me 200 EGP [^8] when I told him my apartment may have been completely destroyed, and he told me to not even think about paying it back - and he would be happy to give more if needed. To put this in perspective, Salem is a young (~23 years old) refugee, saving cash to help his family in Egypt. He doesn't have a high salary, so this 200 EGP was incredibly meaningful.
-   Zainab and Zerrin
    -   These two ladies immediately left their crazy busy work days to help me and my roommate organize my bags of clothes, electronics, etc. _And_ they helped carry my heavy, stinky bags to our office. So kind!
-   Nivella
    -   She personally cleaned some of my nice button-up shirts at her home, with the help of her family. She didn't ask for a thank-you or anything.
-   Chase & Jen
    -   This lovely couple is currently letting me bunk with them! They're American, teachers, soon-to-be-wed, and were so kind to let me break up their chill, no-roommate life. They also were incredibly generous with space, food, towels & sheets, etc.

_Second: Next time, I won't leave the house without..._

When Dina helped me quickly move into my AirBNB on the first night after the fire, I thought I had remembered everything I'd need for the first few days. Unsurprisingly, there were a few important things I left in my old, crispy-fried apartment.

1. Towels
    - Yes, I was still able to shower without a towel. However, since I was in a shared-apartment AirBNB, I couldn't just walk back to my room in my birthday suit, so I opted for drying off with toilet paper. It was a not as easy as I had expected üòÖ
1. Sheets
    - OK Honestly, all of my sheets may have belonged to my landlady, but I'm kinda surprised I didn't even consider packing them. I only thought about sheets once I moved into Chase & Jen's apartment... A bit too late
1. Toiletries
    - Truth be told, I brought one of my toothbrushes, but I don't remember what bag they went in. I wasn't quite prepared to pack everything in my apartment, so I used about 100 little bags from [Social Burger](https://www.facebook.com/SocialBurgerEgy/) to pack my smaller items like toiletries - and some of those bags are still (> 1 month later) locked in a closet at my office
1. Chargers
    - I obviously grabbed my laptop and phone charger, but some items like my electric shaver will be running out of battery soon and I don't know where to replace that in Cairo.

## Thanks

If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking with me in my journey through a burned-up apartment! There were many fantastic memories in that place...

-   Building forts with Isaiah and the twins
-   Celebrating Thanksgiving with work & frisbee friends
-   Bible & Quran studies with my favorite roommates (Alicia & Derek)
-   Video-game nights with Eihab
-   Babysitting the little dudes (I miss them so much!!)
-   Coding events (Cairo Codes + teaching React to co-workers)
-   Proposing to ‚ù§ Dina ‚ù§
-   (and many more)

... but I guess it's time to move on. I'm getting married soon and seriously planning to leave the country. Maybe this act of God was just that - an act of God. It _uprooted_ me just enough to force me to strongly consider what life would look like for us in the USA. It _shook_ me just enough to compel me to search for stability and strength, which I've consistently found in Dina. And it _prepared_ me for this reality: life in Egypt has been absolutely amazing, but Dina and I belong somewhere else. Somewhere we can thrive and build our family.

Thanks again for reading, have a lovely day :)

[^1]: Information Technology, for those of you who don't understand the acronym. _Hmmm, will anyone with IT challenges be able to find this sneaky popup definition?_
[^2]: One fantastic benefit of facilitating trainings for CBOs is that facilitators get _free lunch_ on training days!
[^3]: She even let me into the building, the ~ 10 times I locked myself out over the previous year and a half :D
[^4]: I know I know, he also should know because he lived in the apartment... And yeah, duh, that means his stuff could have been scorched.
[^5]: Technically it took us about 20 minutes to find each other and blah blah it took us a while to meet at the apartment, but that part of the story is boring. Continuing...
[^6]: If I were here, I probably would have thrown in some "choice" words... Again proving how kind and humble she and her family are.
[^7]: Can't skip frisbee practice :D Fire or not!
[^8]: Egyptian Pounds... Is this obvious? Did I need this note?
