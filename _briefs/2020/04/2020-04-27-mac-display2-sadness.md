title: Fool me once, Apple... üò†

Early this month I thought "Hey... I should start using my second monitor again!"

I used to use that monitor with the desktop Dell I bought a few years back for 950 EGP (about \$55 at the time). However, my desktop seems to have a burnt out motherboard. I suspect it has something to do with the fire in my apartment last January üßê

Anyway, now I'm using a MacBook Pro (lent to me by my current employer), and I thought it would be rad to get 2 screens up and running like I have at my desktop in Nevada.

My naive self thought minimal research was required, and I could buy any adapter I wanted. So I shelled out 60 EGP (\$4) to buy this [HDMI to VGA](https://egypt.souq.com/eg-en/1080p-hdmi-male-to-vga-female-video-converter-adapter-cable-with-audio-for-pc-dvd-hdtv-7631401/i/) adapter.

Unsurprisingly, my lack of research led to disappointment. After a quick failure during installation of my first adapter, I found [this article](http://www.head4space.com/macbook-pro-hdmi-to-vga-convertors-not-working/) explaining that standard HDMI to VGA cables don't work for MacBook Pros (and many Mac laptops). I skimmed it quickly and decided "Fine, I guess I can drop a bit more dough ü§ëfor this _fancy_ [thunderbolt to HDMI, VGA, DVI](https://egypt.souq.com/eg-en/ugreen-mini-displayport-to-hdmi-dvi-vga-adapter-4k-mini-dp-converter-thunderbolt-compatible-3-in-1-for-mac-2015-macbook-pro-air-imac-surface-pro3-pro4-google-chromebook-pc-projector-white-35416997/i/) adapter."

Give me 2 - 3 weeks and I'll let you know if I've found success ;)
