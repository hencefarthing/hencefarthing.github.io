Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from Hacker News. It's always short-lived, because for reasons I've never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles *always* get blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It's apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it's a shame the articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who don't like Daring Fireball.

Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage, though, the comment threads still exist. I went through [the Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review][hn] today, and a few comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my attention:

These remarks caught my attention because a technically-savvy family member was confused by the same thing the first time they tried to buy an app on their new iPhone X. They showed me the phone [with the "Double Click to Pay" animation][a]<sup id="fnr1-2017-12-28">[&#x0094;]</sup> and asked me, "What am I supposed to double click here? It doesn't work." What they had tried was double tapping on the "Double Click to Pay" label on screen. When I explained that the animation was pointing to the physical side button, the proverbial light bulb turned on.

This is an interesting design dilemma. The reason why Apple requires you to press the physical side button to confirm a purchase with Apple Pay or in the App Store is because pressing the side button can't be faked by an app. If it was an on-screen button, a nefarious app could present a fake Apple Pay button. With any normal app, clicking the side button once will always lock the screen, and double-clicking will put you in Apple Pay mode. Only Apple's own software can override the side button like this. Double clicking the side button to confirm a purchase effectively guarantees that it was a legitimate payment experience.

But: people naturally expect everything they do on an iPhone to be done on screen. The screen *is* the phone -- and that's even more true with the iPhone X. Even with an animation pointing to the side button on screen, it doesn't occur to people that they need to do something off-screen to authorize the transaction. They think the affordance on the side of the screen [*is* the button they're supposed to double tap](https://twitter.com/brentdax/status/946737462184894464) (and they don't notice the verbal distinction between "click" and "tap").

I'm not sure what the solution here is, but I think Apple needs to come up with a better indication -- perhaps something more explicit, the first time you encounter it -- that you need to click the hardware button, not tap something on screen.

**Update:** This problem is not new to Face ID. Touch ID has a similar problem. Here's a note I got today from a friend:

**Update 2:** Some more commentary.
