excerpt: Dina and I went to Lebanon and had an amazing time!
---

Woohoo, Yippee-ki-yay! We're traveling again!

Dina and I have been _waiting_, _dreaming_, _lusting_ to travel as we've been seemingly stuck in Egypt for over a year [^1]. In early June, Dina got in contact with a travel company in Egypt called [I Can Travel](https://www.facebook.com/icantravelpage). They have a very small team (just a dude and his wife) but they offer very reasonably priced and well organized trips to a few nearby countries. How could we **not** jump on that train?? So we joined them on their trip to Beirut, Lebanon!

Here's a move-by-move travel log of our adventure. Enjoy :)

## Friday, Day 1: Travel to Beirut

On Friday in the early afternoon, Dina and I Ubered to the Cairo airport. We met up with the rest of the tour group, chatted about our expectations for the trip, then we were off! Our flight from Cairo to Beirut reminded me of my time at Epic (2014 - 2016) when I frequently flew from Madison to Chicago. We waited a while at the airport, took off, and a few minutes after we were allowed to turn electronics on, we started our descent. In total, the flight from Cairo to Beirut took just over an hour (~75 minutes).

Upon arriving in Beirut, Dina and I immediately noted our satisfaction that we weren't in charge. We didn't need to figure out what type of visa to buy, nor which office to buy it from. We were delighted to feel the relaxation that came with traveling with a tour group. Multiple times our tour guide, Ammer, led us from one area of the airport to another. First we sat in comfy chairs while Ammar waited in line to buy us all visas. Then Ammar shuffled us to an office adjacent to customs windows. Then back, and back again. We spend about an hours shuffling around while Ammar seemed to have a difficult time buying all of our visas, but Dina and I were relaxed! We didn't have a stress in the world - we were on vacation, and Ammar was figuring out how to move us forward! After we got through the customs line, we were excited to get out of the airport. Sadly, another hour passed until we found our bags [^2]. Someone had pulled our small suitcase off the belt and was resting their legs on it, making it very difficult for us to see! Dina finally spotted it and we were off!

As we exited the airport, we were introduced to our tour-guide-to-be, Bassem. He's a local Lebanese tour guide in Beirut, who speaks at least 3 languages (and multiple Arabic dialects), and proved his deep knowledge of the city many times over. He explained a bit of what our plans would be for the night, then we jumped on a bus with him and we were finally on vacation!

Our first stop was in downtown Beirut, a little square with a monument and Bassem explained how the area was "similar" to Cairo's Tahrir square. He explained there had been many revolutions in the area, and you could even see bullet holes in the monument. As we walked around a bit, Bassem showed us a few areas where shops used to line the streets. There wasn't any glass where the storefronts used to be... Something was eerie about the area. Bassem explained that when the chemical plant exploded not too long ago, the effects were felt tens of kilometers away - including the streets we were walking along. We saw the beautiful Mohammad AlAmin Mosque and continued to an area that had been barricated by the government, as many revolutions had started where some popular streets converted. The sight was similarly grim, giving me shivers just thinking about what had happened years before, in the exact place I stood.

Before heading back, Bassem also gave us a tour of an area with ancient ruins from the Romans. Over the next few days we'd stop at a number of other ruins.

Once back at the hotel, Ammer gave us a 1 hour break. Dina and I showered, unpacked, and got ready for the final activity of the day - dinner! Down in the lobby we exchanged $ to L.L., and scurried off to the Snack Barbar. The Snack Barbar looked like one street-food restaurant, but it was split into at least 5 parts - falafel & bean sandwiches, bakery, meat and chicken shawerma, pizza, and desserts. I bought 2 meat shawerma sandwiches and was stuffed. We walked back to the hotel, prepared for bed, and passed out.

### Daily notes

My current plan is to save some interesting notes for these sections, so the above can flow as activities happen. I'm thinking it could be nice to break these articles into more pieces so you (the reader) have more opportunity for breaks as you read. If you like them, GREAT! Tell me, and I'll do this again next time. If you don't like it, OOPS! Tell me, and I'll think about changing my style next time (no promises) 😜

Note #1: If you had to guess, how much L.L. would you guess each meat shawerma sandwich cost, at the Snack Barbar? If you guessed 35,000 L.L. you win a fish prize!

Note #2: I think 35,000 L.L. sounds a bit steep, don't you? Well, what I didn't mention yet is that Dina and I had exchanged $200 in the hotel. This $200 fetch us a hefty 2,600,000 L.L. 😱 That's right! Day 1 in Beirut, we were already multi-millionaires! Note-within-a-note: This exchange rate is the "black-market" rate, not what banks offer (yet).

## Saturday, Day 2; What an intro!

We awoke nice and early. Sun crept into our room on the edge of our thick curtains, and we were pumped for Day 2! We popped down to the hotel breakfast around 8:30 so we could be ready for the bus by 9:30. Breakfast was buffet-style with many delicious options. There was a variety of cheese slices, some sliced cold veggies, bakery (sweet and savory), and separate bowls with cooked beans, omlets, potatoes, tomatoes, or boiled eggs. The drink options were limited to water or coffee, but we definitely weren't complaining. At 9:30 everyone in the group had had their breakfast and we jumped into the bus, brimming with exitement!

As we drove, many people in the tour were taking pictures and videos of the amazing scenery all around us. Dina can confirm, multiple times I compared the sights to colorful Colorado. We drove for a while until we got out of the metropolis. Our first stop was at a small market for a bathroom break [^3]. We hit the road pretty quickly, drove a bit, then found ourselves stopping at a crack in a mountain where there was a beautiful waterfall. We climbed around, took some beautiful pictures, then found out the waterfall continued on the other side of the road! Bassem led us across the street and down a steep stairway, and we found ourselves on a beautiful little coffee shop patio with a view of the second part of the waterfall! There were even a few local kids who climbed out to the source of the waterfall and jumped! Our group enjoyed the view, drank some coffee, ate some delicious cherries, relaxed a while, then were ready to hit the road again.

Here's the location of the waterfall / coffee shop paradise: ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Fr1QhtrgzHCXsJRC7)])

Our next stop was just before the ridge of one of the mountains. I didn't know what we were about to do... Until I saw some 4-wheelers. My excitement grew... A **lot**. Before I knew what was happening, Dina and I were in a 2-person 4-wheeler, roaring up a mountain road! We zoomed around a while as the tour group was guided up the ridge, around some gnarly turns, and finally back to the start. I hope the brevity of my description does not indicate a less than exciting romping! Dina and I thoroughly enjoyed our time, and I was even _more_ excited when I found out the next step was lunch!

Right next to the 4-wheeler business was a restaurant called Saj Zoufa where we spent a few hours eating **delicious** mixed grill and appetizers. Dina and I enjoyed the food and the company - we sat next to Ammar, Bassem, and a fellow traveler we'd get to know better, named Nader. After everyone had their fill, it was time for more thrill seeking!

Next stop: Zip lining and walking on a monkey bridge! Our bus pulled into a parking lot on the side of a mountain. I didn't see how we would zipline along the side of a mountain, unless we were going to hike up a while; but I quickly ruled out that idea due to the athletic abilities of some of our tour-mates. We got out and walked along a beautiful gorge between us and the mountain. Aha! Maybe we were going to zipline in the gorge! That's exactly what we did. First we put on a harness and helmet to stay safe as we walked across a monkey bridge. This was a bit scarier than expected, but Dina and I had some good laughs and even took a selfie in the middle of the bridge. After crossing the rickety bridge, we ziplined back across the gorge and climbed down a bit farther. From here, there was a final zipline to the floor of the gorge, but this time was different - Dina and I zipped at the same time! The final zipline was powered - it let us down slowly and gently the whole way. This is how we were brave enough to take this next video :D

At the bottom, we took some incredible pictures of a massive hole that had developed in the ground. In Winter, we were told, lots of water rushed down into the hole, resulting in a beautiful waterfall. In June, apparently, only a little trickle of water fell - nevertheless the pictures we took were incredibly beautiful. We took pictures for 30 minutes, then headed back up, walked to the bus, and were off!

Here's the location of the latest adventure at Baatara George Waterfall: ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/TgtCMLz7j5Wr5Ymv9))

Our next step was a local lemonade store - the first in Lebanon, called the Lemon House. We toured the museum a bit while Ammar organized lemonades for everyone, then Bassem gave us a little tour near the sea while we drank our refreshing juices. The light was starting to fade at this point, so we hopped back in to bus and headed in the direction of our hotel.

What a day, right? Seems like the end to a perfect day. But wait... There's a bit more! Between the Lemon House and our hotel, we stopped at an ice cream store (Bassem's favorite) called Hellado ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/fLNtdKyAx1ydYugq9)). I decided I wanted a cup, so I was told to pick a whopping **5 FLAVORS** to scoop in! I don't remember all the flavors I chose, but the outcome... Perfection.

With that, we were happy to head home! I was pooped but pumped about all we had seen during that day. We arrived at the hotel, bought a few essentials (mainly snacks from a nearby market), then passed out.

### Daily notes

Note #3: Dina is an amazing travel companion. Have I mentioned that before? Yes. Will I mention it again? You betcha. She knows I get a bet hangry (angry when I'm hungry) so she makes sure to pack extra snacks for the road, she's the one making sure we take nice pictures at _almost_ every destination, and she's just overall a joy to travel with.

Note: If I'm honest, I was a bit disappointed Ammer and Bassem hadn't told me there would be a chance to swim (and jump off a waterfall) this day. I believe I would have packed my swimsuit & joined the adrenaline junkies if I'd known ahead of time... But I was still incredibly happy with the day :)

Note: Dina and I reflected on all that we had done that day, and we agreed that it would have taken _way too much_ effort to plan such an action-packed, adrenaline-seeking day. We again agreed it was an amazing choice to come to Beirut on this guided tour.

## Sunday - Day 3; 

And we rise! Breakfast at 8:45, bus at 9:45, we were excited to see what would be in store for the day!

First stop: Rawsha Rock. This is a beautiful, huge rock in the sea that has whethered in such a way that a hole was created! According to Bassem, until very recently there were 2 rocks like this in the world - one here in Beirut, another [**ELSEWHERE**?? - search?!?]. However, not long before our trip the other had collapsed, so we found ourselves looking at the only rock like this in the world! After taking some nice pictures it was time to move on.

Stop two was Moussa's castle. Bassem explained that there was a man named Mussa who built a castle because when he was a kid, he fell in love with a girl and he promised her he would build her a castle. She didn't end up loving him, but he kept the dream his whole life, and brick by brick he built a very impressive castle on the side of a mountain! Over the years he also sculpted some famous scenes like The Last Supper, and he even sculpted a time when he was a kid and had drawn plans for his castle during class! The teacher reprimanded him, but he never gave his dream up - amazing! Touring the castle took longer than expected, as the second half of the tour involved exploring Mussa's record-setting collection of weapons. This was amusing for me and Dina, but we weren't too enthralled. We picked up the pace and took more pictures of the view once outside.

Right before getting on the bus, Ammer purchased a delicious dessert called [**SOMETHING**??], and shared it with the group! It had pistachio on top and bottom, with delicious creamy filling in the middle. I wanted to bring some to my family in the US, but I know it wouldn't have survived that long.

Back on the bus, we found ourselves on our way to an old presidential palace, Beit Ed-Dine Palace. Here, Bassem explained a lot about the architecture and history, but Dina and I were honestly a bit tired and not too interested in the history here, so we mainly walked around and enjoyed the scenery.

Next on the tour: Barouk Cedar Forest. This protectorate is way up on a mountain and was a perfect next stop. Touring the palace & Mussa's castle had drained some of our energy, but this forest brought it all back quickly. The air was so crisp and clean, we heard birds chirping, and we even slowed way down so the tour group could go ahead and we could enjoy some peace and quiet. This forest was one of the highlights for me (and I believe for Dina too). Since living in Cairo, I haven't seen such a forest in a long time - it was even more impressive and enjoyable than many of the hikes I've been on in Colorado! [^4].

After getting back to the bus, we were all ready for some food. We'd walked around a museum, a big palace, and a forest at this point. So where did we eat? Paradise. Literally. Paradise is a beautiful restaurant, built in a spectacular area of Lebanon. Our bus couldn't even make it down the road to Paradise because it was so steep and narrow. But after we walked down the winding road and saw how the restaurant was perfectly situated between a gorgeous waterfall and a natural swimming pool, we were all _blown away_. I don't think my words could ever come close to describing the breathtaking beauty of Paradise, so instead I'll recommend you check out the photos from the day :)

Nader and I were the only ones brave enough to jump into the pool (and the only ones stupid enough to pay 50,000 L.L. to do it), but we agreed it was a great decision to do so. The water was a bit murky, but it was cold and crisp - exactly what we needed after a big dinner and a tiring day of touring. Once we cleaned up and were ready to go, we hiked back up the crazy steep street, jumped into the bus, and headed home.

Once again, instead of going directly from amazing adventure to the hotel, we took a halfway break at a nut shop and bought a few bags of delicious cashews, peanuts, and corn nuts. The prices here were much cheaper than in Cairo, plus we had the opportunity to get a great gift for my dad and Dina's niece and nephew!

Finally we arrived home... Tired and ready for bed, with absolutely nothing to complain about.

### Daily notes

Note: One amazing thing about the "seaside" in Beirut is that there's a _huge_ sidewalk. Dina and I talked for a while about how incredible this is, and it encourages and enables a healthy, active lifestyle. We daydreamed about living in Beirut by the seaside, riding our bikes or walking along the walkway every morning. Hopefully we'll have the chance to stay longer in Beirut and live that dream ❤️

## Monday - Day 4; Rafting!

On Monday I remember thinking, "Wow, it's Monday already?" and "Wow, the trip isn't over already?" at the same time. By now we had seen amazing sights, participated in some very enjoyable activities, and yet we still had 2 more days of the guided tour! Let's do this 🤓

We woke & ate breakfast extra early on Monday because we knew we had a long drive ahead of us. Today we heard we were going to go rafting!! Along our way we had a few interesting stops. The first stop of the day was a little pee break, and our tour guide bought us mana'ouch with zaatar and safi7a with la7ma. Both were incredibly delicious! We continued down the road and took a second pee stop at a dessert shop, where some of our tour-mates bought dessert that was basbousa inside a burger bun. The dessert may have been tasty, but Dina and I weren't _that_ hungry yet.

Our first real stop of the day was at some impressive Roman ruins. We saw where a few humongous temples had been built, listened to a bit of history from the tour guide, and took lots of pictures. This stop was in a very hot part of the day, so we were all ready for the next stop - rafting!

We finally arrived at our destination. The company had built a pretty nice patio overlooking the largest rapid, which made many people a bit nervous. We got life-jackets on and climbed in the back of a pickup truck that took us up the river. Dina and I almost got placed in different tubes, but luckily at the last minute they put us together, in the front of one tube :) The river was pretty slow, and the rapids were all pretty tame (compared to Colorado's rivers), but we all had a super fun time. The rafting guides were also very kind and entertaining, and they spurred a few boat-to-boat waterfights along the river 💦. Once we dried off and got back to the main patio, dinner was served. More mixed grill and fattouch, my favorite!!

After a while, all was said and done. We knew we had a long drive home, so I tried to get some sleep as we drove. We took one pee break at a shop selling lots of yogurt an cheese, then we hit the road for the last time.

This night we were pretty pooped from so much driving, so we cleaned up, did covid tests (for our flight back to Cairo), and brought some [Snack Barbar](https://goo.gl/maps/HRUFYzTxiU6iFaza7) shawerma back to our room so we could watch Friends, eat, and sleep.

### Daily notes

Note: Today, Bassem took a day off so we had a lady replace him. She was super friendly as well and took a more "friendly" approach to her job than Bassem. She didn't give us as many historical notes along our trip, but I don't think Dina and I were sad. We did miss Bassem, however.

Note: When we were about to arrive at our rafting stop, there was a little security checkpoint. Apparently we were relatively close to the Syria-Lebanon border, so they checked to make sure we were just a boring group of tourists. We passed the check relatively quickly, but they hesitated once they heard there was an American on the bus. 👀 I never heard what they asked about me or why they were nervous about an American on board, maybe that's a good thing?

## Tuesday - Day 5; Paragliding!

Finally Tuesday had come. This was our last day on Ammar's guided tour, giving us some mixed feelings. We knew it was going to be a fun last day though, so we were up by 8:30, ready to leave at 9:30.

Today we didn't go too far from our hotel - instead, we stopped where we could take a Telefrique (gondola?) up to a high ridge on the edge of a mountain. Nearby was a beautiful, quiet, serene prayer area where many people come to worship Mary. We spent a decent amount of time here reflecting on our trip, how blessed we were to be in a beautiful country like Lebanon, and how happy and peaceful we felt in that place.

After relaxing a while, it was our turn to paraglide! Our tour group split into 2 groups because the paragliding comopany couldn't take all 9 of us to the edge of the mountain at the same time. Dina and I were in the first group. We waited our turn, got on our gear, and slowly made our way to edge of the mountain. Before we took off, they gave us clear instructions: keep moving forward at a brisk pace, don't bend your knees, and don't stop once we start. I waited for my tandem partner to give me the green light, and we were off! The feeling was so incredible... You're soaring over the mountain, then the sea, and you feel like there's nothing wrong with the world. I was sad my flight had to end, but when I landed I was waiting for Dina, ready to ask when we can do that again! Sadly, Dina didn't have as enjoyable of an experience...

When Dina landed I ran over to ask her how she loved paragliding, and I could see something was wrong. Since early that morning, she had noted her stomach was a bit wonky, and sadly right as she jumped off the mountain, her stomach started feeling terrible. For the next few hours after landing, Dina tried sleeping on the bus (and at Dinner closeby). I tried helping by asking some locals for water and soda, but Dina felt so terrible it was hard for her to get anything in her stomach. Luckily one of our travel buddies named Amira was a doctor, and Dina had brought a shot that a doctor in Cairo recommended for her. It took a while, but eventually she started feeling better and was able to enjoy another delicious lunch by the seaside.

[- byblos???? - ruins, Snack, chill]

[- old streets & shops? Is that byblos?? ]

Eventually we had had enough fun, looked at enough souveniers, and drank enough juice. We'd been out again for what seemed like forever, but our fatigue was easily offset by the fun we were having. It was time to head home. Since this was our last guided day, we all said our goodbyes to Bassem. Dina and I invited him to come to Cairo and we honestly hope he will come some day.

We arrived at the hotel and decided to do a fun date-night at a restaurant near the hotel called T'Marbouta ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/7KDzrKSAKyKPzFnb8)). I had fattouch once again (I can never have too much fattouch), and Dina had delicious bread with cheese (I don't know the name of the dish). We enjoyed our time even when Dina had to make a work call, and after some time we headed home and slept.

### Daily notes

Note: When I was on the edge of the mountain about to start gliding, my right show almost fell off!! I barely held onto it with my other foot as we soared over the nothingness, and eventually I was able to stabilize. I told my guide about the situation, and he told me it's pretty common for people to lose a shoe when taking off. I didn't ask how / if it was also common that they got their shoes back??

## Wednesday - Day 6; Shopping 'till we Drop! 

Sadly, hump day had inevitably arrived. Wednesday was our last day in Lebanon and we planned to head to the airport around 1:30pm, so Ammar gave us the day to do as we pleased. Since we had seen more sights and gone on more exciting adventures than we'd ever dreamed, there was only one activity left to do: SHOP!

Dina and I woke up by 9 so we could eat the delicious hotel breakfast for the final time. We were planning to meet some of our travel buddies in the morning so we could carpool to a nearby mall, but they ended up bailing and just shopping on the streets next to the hotel. More alone time for me and Dina? Not a problem to me! We took a quick 10 minute Uber from the hotel to ABC Verdun (for 11,000 LL). ABC Verdun is a _beautiful_ mall that's partially indoor, partially outdoor! From the bottom 2 levels, it looks and feel like any other traditional mall - one main loop with lots of shops on both sides. When I got to the third floor I started noticing the ceiling, which wasn't actually a ceiling... It was some huge oval panels that looked kinda like giant leafs! We found ourselves at a Starbucks lined with mini trees (Derek!), and chilled here for a while, enjoying the unique nature of the mall.

A few hours later we decided to finish our Beirut adventure with some final shopping near our hotel. We Ubered back (for 16,000 LL) [^5], shopped around the hotel for a few hours, then stopped for lunch at The BBQ House.

Finally it was time to get back to reality. We took a bus (with the rest of the tour group) to the airport nice and early (to be 100% sure we won't get caught in insane rush hour traffic), I took a nice nap on Dina's lap while waiting to board, then as quickly as we arrived we were back in Cairo, back to real life.

### Daily notes

Note: Around the end of this trip I decided to travel back to Denver, CO to see my family - which was a fantastic decision. I got to see my mom (who lives in Nevada), my sis and her family (who live in Florida) and my dad! Not to mention my amazing aunt & uncle, grandma, and some fantastic old friends.

## Final remarks

So that's it! Our lovely trip to Lebanon. I wasn't expecting Beirut to be so lush, but alas! I couldn't have been so impressed.

I have a few tertiary thoughts I'd like to share, so here I go :D

First, I wanted to note that I was quite happy I didn't buy a data plan and it was overall a good thing that the bus didn't have WiFi. Being on a bus without access to the internet really ~helped~ forced me to focus on the beautiful surrounds and it helped me build a few relationships with fellow travelers. I met a cool dude named Nader, who until recently was some director at the Four Seasons, and has three beautiful kids but sadly lost his wife last year. And I also met a really entertaining coder named Ahmed, who lives in Alexandria, does remote front-end software development (like me) for a company in Boston! I even really enjoyed chatting with the trip guide Ammar and the Lebanese tour guide Bassem, and I truly believe if I had easy internet access I would have spend more time reading work emails and keeping in contact with people far away, instead of living Beirut to the fullest and meeting some incredible people around me.

Next, the tour group. I loved this trip, don't get me wrong... But I struggled a lot when Dina could easily chat with all members of the group (in Arabic) while I had to find the few people who speak English. And, as you may expect, I don't just loudly advertise "HEY ye who speak English, come hither and talk to me so I'm not bored!!" Luckly, as I mentioned above, Nader was super friendly throughout our trip, and when I eventually met Ahmed we immediately hit it off and lots of development-related topics to discuss :)

And finally, the economic situation in Lebanon (as I saw it - I'm not claiming to be an expert here). I just want to mention how sad Dina and I felt for the people living in Beirut - specifically for the economic hardship everyone is experiencing. Have you ever lived in a country where your money was worth X one day, and 1/2 * X (half as much) the next day?? Technically I was in Egypt when the value of the egyptian pound (EGP) dropped by more than half overnight, but all of my money was in dollars at the time (thank goodness) so I'm going to say this doesn't count. I can't imagine if my savings, salary, investments dropped in value overnight... When Dina and I were first in Beirut we received 13,000 LL for $1, but as I'm writing this sentence, I've heard the converstion rate recently increased to **19,000 L.L. to $1!!** Just insane. I pray this country will get back on its feet soon, as I see how beautiful the country is, how delicious the food is, how amazing the people are.

[^1]: Ok ok, I've been back to the US at least 3 times in the last year and Dina came with for 2 months, but we haven't been on a proper _vacation_ in a while, since while we were in the US I was laser focused on job hunting.
[^2]: This may have been the only stressful part of the trip 😅
[^3]: Surprise surprise, in larger groups there's always someone who needs to use the restroom. This wasn't annoying for me or Dina, we repeatedly noted how happy we were that we didn't have to plan out this trip :D
[^4]: Ok, in reality, walking around the Cedar forest cannot be called a "hike". It's a casual stroll, on a defined path, between some huge, ancient cedar trees. Amazing.
[^5]: Our Uber driver seemed very pessimistic and complained a lot, which was a bit offputting since our experience w/ Lebanon had been so fun and exciting so far. Eventually he explained how waiting in line for gas could take over 4 hours 😱 **AND** the price of gas has SOARED! I felt bad for immediately judging him, the economic situation in Lebanon seems it has really taken a turn for the worse :(
