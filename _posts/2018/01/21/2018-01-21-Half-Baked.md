I know I ~~promised~~ mentioned some posts on half-baking things. So I‚Äôll first mention I just one-and-a-half-baked some delicious peppermint chocolate chip cookies to technically fulfill that promise.  
And then I will quickly move along to something different because its ~~my~~ our blog and I‚Äôll do what ~~I~~ we want! And now we will quickly move along to‚Ä¶

## The Future of the Website
First, let‚Äôs be perfectly clear in establishing one thing: Alex and I have no idea what we‚Äôre doing. I know diddly about making/running websites, and I only know a couple things about writing. Alex definitely knows more about making websites, coding, and attracting an audience, and its arguable that he knows more about writing.[^cmon, I wanna be ok at something] But we are both still n00bs. And because of that, the website is currently running on Squarespace because I heard about it on a podcast and I‚Äôm a sucker.[^If you use Squarespace because you heard about it on a podcast, don‚Äôt feel bad. Unless you were like me and did 0 research. In which case you *may* be a sucker.]  
Squarespace is a great platform, and I have run some other websites off of it before! But it doesn‚Äôt play quite as nicely with my current ~~iOS-only~~ iOS-first computing style. That combined with our inexplicable desire to make things more difficult for ourselves, we are looking at switching to a blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com) with the assistance of [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). So far everything looks awesome and I think that will give us everything we are looking for, with one minor issue: me having no idea what I‚Äôm doing.  
To make a short story long, I‚Äôve changed my mind and have decided to do a series of posts about learning what I‚Äôm doing with html, css, Jekyll, GitHub, etc.. Hopefully (ü§ûüèº) this series will culminate with us switching the website over to this new platform, and me having a more workable solution to posting from iOS.
