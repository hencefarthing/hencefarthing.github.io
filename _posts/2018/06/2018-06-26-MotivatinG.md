title: The Secret to Success Isn't You
---

For those of you who don't know me,[^1] I have spent the last several years struggling with some movement difficulties, in large part thanks to the foolishness and arrogance of Past Logan.[^2] Throughout those years, I've felt lots of ways about these difficulties -- acceptance, anger, sadness, regret, frustration, optimism, fear, etc… There were days I tried to come to grips that I would just be like this forever. There were days I thought it would go away if I only did these certain things a few times. ~~There's been days~~ Every day I've felt anger and frustration and past me for getting me in this mess. Or not doing enough to get me out of it.

Until a little bit over a year ago. I decided this had to be the main focus of my free time, as well as any seconds I could spare it attention the rest of the time. When I say it this way, it sounds like I made a decision, or I finally figured out a way to motivate myself to do what needed to be done. That's not the case.
I'd tried to motivate myself before, and failed every time. It ended with feelings of anger and frustration at past Logan and eventual failure.

## So why would this time be different?
I couldn't motivate myself. But, luckily for me, the people around me are some most caring people in the world. My then fiancee essentially convinced me that it was now or never and set me a goal to  reach before our wedding.[^3] My mom was as encouraging and helpful as she's always been, and after two and a half decades, it finally got through my head that I should listen to what she says sometimes. And of course I learned I was going to be an uncle. This suddenly made the idea of me having my own kids someday very real. I realized I could never be the kind of dad I would hope to be (the kind of dad my dad is), if I didn't fix my body. So that's how it started.

We found a trainer that seemed like a good personality match for us[^4], and set up a plan for my wife and I to work out with him twice a week, and me go in on my own once a week. Having my wife along with me was also a huge help: it detracted from the pain and frustration of those early days. And boy did it suck. Progress was slow, I ached every day, and every exercise was a reminder of how much further I had to go. But Marc, our trainer, knows what he is doing, and is very good at pushing us enough to improve, but so much that we feel like we can't do it. And my wife was there to encourage me and help hold me accountable. It seemed like an incredibly long road ahead of me, and I didn't know if I would ever reach my goal. But every journey starts with a single step.

## Well that didn't actually explain how you motivated yourself
I was unable to motivate myself, and for everything that's mattered in my life, I've found the trick is to surround yourself by people who love you and who will support you through anything. I couldn't have made the progress I did without the help of all my family, Marc, and my friends. But in the end, I had to do the work to change what I wanted to. The first few weeks were the hardest part, when I was still trying to convince my brain that this was my top priority. I had to constantly remind myself to think about my posture, think about how I moved, think about walking correctly. It seemed like I couldn't do anything -- even sit or _lay on the couch_ -- without realizing I was doing it wrong.

But after a few weeks of _constant vigilance_[^5] all those things became engrained. And the pace of progress started to  improve. I was able to lift a little more weight. I was able to go to the second easiest band on my hip strengthening exercises. I was able to lunge correctly. It didn't hurt to lay on my back anymore. And every _single_ time I noticed one of these, I tried to remember to note it. Often I wrote it down in my Journal. Sometimes I would tell someone -- my wife, my parents, my friends. Almost every time Marc noticed. And[^6] every time there was some celebration. At least a congratulations or a high five.
With every celebration, I found myself slightly more addicted to the workouts, the exercises, even the stretches and foam rolling which are always so miserable. And the progress kept getting better.

## Everyone loves a happy ending
I failed to fix this and take care of myself countless number of times, and to be honest, I'm certainly going to fail on other things in the future. But right now, I'm succeeding, and the biggest reason is the support of other people, not some magical new way of thinking or tricking myself into doing the hard work. I've made huge strides[^7] through months of constant determination and effort. Just in the past couple weeks we found a series of foam rolling and stretches that makes a huge difference in my posture and the tightness of my muscles. It's led to new ranges of motion rather than just an increased range of motion. I feel great (although very sore), and very optimistic about what is coming next. I've achieved more than I hoped to achieve, and I've very nearly achieved the goals I set for myself many, many long months ago. And I'm even daring to dream about new goals beyond these!

This post was a bit more personal than some of our other ones, and I also feel like I'm still not sure what point I was trying to deliver in writing it. But it felt great to get it written and get it out in the world. This next month I'll probably try to write some less heavy posts! Only time will tell. Now, it's time for me to go do my exercises!!
