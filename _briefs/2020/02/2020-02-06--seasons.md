excerpt: Why four?

Four seasons seems arbitrary and doesn't quite match reality in some areas. Here's the **five** seasons I think of at my home:
1. Hot (July, August, early September)
2. Fall (Late September, October)
3. Cold (November, December, January) 
4. Snow (February, March, early April) 
5. Spring (Late April, May, June)

What are the seasons where you live?
