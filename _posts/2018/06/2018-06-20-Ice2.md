It has now been a few months since the first episode of [Icelanditures](http://hencefarthing.blog/2018/03/05/Ice1/), AND I'm officially back on that slacker path where I need to reuse an old piece of writing. Therefore, today you get part 2 of my incredible adventure to Iceland. If you didn't read Icelanditure part 1, that's fine. You may just be confused about the backstory. [^1]

### *Day 3:*
Today began with one of my favorite activities: Sleep. We all whole-heartily enjoyed the rest. We wouldn't have been able to survive today's activities without it ;)

The real "activeness" of this Tuesday started with some authentic Icelandic milk (and eggs / bacon). Because we still have trouble reading Icelandic, we bought the milk that looked closest to the classic white liquidy liquid made from cows. After smelling the slightly viscous drink that was poured into my cup (thanks for the tip, Dad) I noticed it smelled like yogurt. A tad confused but left with no other choice, we drank yogurt with our breakfast.

Next came the bike ride. The fancy new mountain bikes we rented cost us 4500 isk per person (1000 isk = $8 US. You do the math). [^2] Over the next four hours we saw:

    1. A double rainbow.
    2. A few gorgeous waterfalls.
    3. Sheep.
    4. Sheep.
    ...
    999. Sheep.
    1000. Horses.
    1001. Ruins of the old days.

We learned from the bike shop owner that the people in Seyðisfjörður used to live much more spread out, but in the past 50 years or so they mostly all congregated in the main city.

>Comment about items 3 - 999: We saw way more sheep in this little town than I expected to see in all of Iceland. The cutest part of it was that it seemed like every mother sheep was followed by two cute babies! While biking by one farm we got to pet the two cutest and friendliest baby sheep ever :) (hopefully I can find the pictures somewhere). The trip home was a bit laborious as my buddy Navin developed some mega calf cramps. So we walked, chatted, and laughed during those moments when he wasn't bent over on the ground in pain.

>Quick side note #2: lunch was made by Navin: a sandwich consisting of sliced turkey, cheese, bread, and peanut butter. Who would have known that peanut butter goes well in that combo? I had serious doubts before trying it out. It helps that Icelandic peanut butter is quite delicious.

Once the biking adventure was over, we cooked some dinner. Just some classic spaghetti, but spaghetti coupled with getting out of the sun & off our feet / butts was quite relaxing.

The most fun slice of our day has to be described as my favorite half hour ever. Our post-dinner shenanigans began with riding a mini zipline in the city playground. This was only relatively exciting, but this sparked some interest in the neighborhood kids. (Who are these weirdos and why are they playing on our playground?? - I assume this is what they were thinking.) A friendly puppy joined our romp through the playground (teeter-totter, climbing wall, leap-frog poles, etc) which really peaked some kids' interests as they knew this dog and it's owner. The real fun began when (you guessed it) we pulled out a frisbee. Approximately two minutes into tossing, three little kids asked if they could join us. Only one spoke English, but the others looked interested and fun so we let them join. (They're younger that teenagers so my "fun" comment was supposed to be funny. Hopefully my explanation didn't detract from the joke) [^3] Once the rest of the kids saw how much fun we were having, 7 more ran over and politely asked if they could join as well. We took a few minutes laughing as we tried to learn Icelandic from some of the English-speaking miniature natives, and we even taught them how to trow a flick! By the end of this crazy experience, the frisbee was chewed up a bit and we were ready for the next activity. Navin ended up donating the disc to the kids since they loved it so much and they thanked us all for letting them join in on our fun. I definitely wanted to keep playing with them all day (which never ends) but alas, our story must go on.

The final excursion we embarked on today was to find a stone called the "Dwarf Stone". Apparently Icelanders have some strange obsession with dwarfs and elfs (not much detail here, sorry) so we took it upon ourselves to find the stone so important to those living in Seyðisfjörður. This adventure led us back on the bike trail, down a walking path, over a sheep fence, across a small creek, and onto a beach to find the marveled stone (we took another picture here, hopefully I can find it). At first glance it was slightly underwhelming, but it's apparently pretty cool to some folks here. (quick note: yes, we heard from a local that we were allowed to walk on private property and lots of people do it, while searching for this specific rock).

That's all for tonight, folks. I'm writing this in midnight light (feels like early morning Colorado sunlight) buts it's time to force myself to go to sleep so another exciting day can begin.

P.S. Here are some things I learned today:
1. Just because a bike is "new", that doesn't mean it's bright and shiny and ready for adventure. It can still have super squeaky breaks or chains that fall off easily.
2. Icelandic children are very polite and friendly.

## Thanks!
This adventure is now a bit over two years old. It's strange how quickly time flies sometimes. It feels like it was just last month that we were roaming the island in search of the Dwarf Stone.

Anyway, thanks for reading! There's still more Iceland adventure writing to come, but I'll probably keep you waiting.


[^1]: This is me subtly (or not) trying to convince you to read part 1 before continuing.

[^2]: Or if you don't want to... 4500 isk per person at 1000 idk per $8 US, you get (4500 isk / 1000 isk) * $8 = $36 per person.

[^3]: I left this in the story because it shows how sometimes I make myself laugh but can't explain to anyone else why something is funny. This comment, a few years later, is definitely not funny.
