Over the past five months or so I've been working on a project which will save time for people[^1] at my work. My goal is to create a tutorial video on how to use a database management system that I've been managing throughout my time in Cairo.

## The Past
Over the past year and a half, I've gone through a few different phases of organizing trainings and tutorials on our system. Here's a little breakdown of how each phase has gone.

### Phase 1
At the beginning of my career in Cairo, I was quickly put in a position where I helped implement a database management system. Once we went live[^6] I worked with a team of 3 to teach the entire organization how to use the system. This occurred on 3 separate training days, each day consisting of two 4-hour sessions. This went well and was very useful for us as trainers, as we were questioned about many minute details of the system that we never would have thought of before. As people followed along during the sessions, we ran into a few crazy bugs[^2] we never came across in our testing.

After the initial all-staff trainings finished, I realized a slightly unsettling truth: this was only the beginning. To understand a bit about the reality I found myself in, you must first learn some details about the organization at which I am employed[^3].

>This organization has grown over the past few years. It seems to act like a small startup where new departments are created left and right, and almost every program is constantly hiring new people. The hiring craze never ends because of two main factors: organization expansion as I mentioned above, and rapid turnover. Many of the staff members here are technically volunteers who only plan to stay for 6 months to 1 year. Additionally, many of our staff members are refugees who end up getting resettled[^4]. Expansion and turnover mean staff members at our organization are constantly coming & going, coming with no knowledge of how our database management system works, and leaving without transferring that information to their replacements. So who gets to fill the newbies with all of the delicious knowledge they need for being successful with our system? Woo-hoo! Pick me! Pick me!

So now you can hopefully understand a bit of the pickle I found myself in. Staff were constantly being hired without knowledge of the system we use here, so they needed to be trained. And since I had the deepest knowledge of the system, this role got thrown to me. Let's look at the next phase :D

### Phase 2
Immediatly following the all-staff trainings, I found myself shifting to a new strategy of scheduling trainings. New staff were still getting hired every month, so I allowed different departments to schedule their trainings with me, whenever they needed it and whenever it fit into their schedules. This quickly became quite hectic as sometimes this landed me with 2 or 3 trainings per week, while some weeks I didn't have anyone to train. I wasn't a huge fan of this chaotic system, so I developed a new plan.

### Phase 3
In this next phase, I got a bit more organized. This time, I scheduled free time every Tuesday from 1 to 2 pm where anyone could have their staff (old or new) attend trainings. This benefited me as I did not have to accommodate anyone else's schedule anymore! [^5] All I had to do was prepare for trainings every Tuesday, show up, do the training, and get on with my day.

This method worked for a while, but eventually one of two situations would happen. First, sometimes nobody would show up to the trainings. This was inevitable, since we obviously didn't have enough people to do 1 training per week for eternity, but it started to annoy me that I would prepare for a training and nobody would show up. Because of this, I sometimes stayed in my shared office if I hadn't heard that anyone needed to be trained that week. Second (after situation #1 happened a few times), sometimes I'd be setting at my workspace, doing my thing (again, assuming nobody needed a training that week), when 15 minutes into the training time I'd get someone calling me to start the training since people were waiting for me! This was very flustering and I would usually do a rushed and poor training for those staff members. When I'm solely responsible for something and people are depending on me, I love doing a good job. Situation #1 got on my nerves, but situation #2 was starting to kill me. I needed a new strategy.

### Phase 4
On my quest to find the best solution, I came up with a totally new idea. Instead of doing all of these trainings in person, saying the same thing week after week, month after month, why don't I do what programmers often attempt to do - make my life more modular, and create some sort of tutorial that can be reused? Whether a current staff member needs a refresher course, OR a new staff member gets hired, they both need the same training. So how can I make this modular tutorial? I decided to create a tutorial video. I immediately got excited about this project since it would potentially relieve me of my training role AND I had never created a tutorial like this before!

So I came up with some ideas of what to talk about, and I threw around some plans to make a PowerPoint. After a few months I felt like I was only working half-heartedly on this tutorial, so I put the project on hold. People had stopped asking for trainings as often, so part of me thought I could get away with just not doing trainings anymore.

Until recently, I kept this frame of mind. I had only been doing one training per month on average, and people reverted back to scheduling trainings with me individually. At such a low frequency, I was ok with these one-off trainings. But in the back of my mind I still dreamed of the day I when I would finish my tutorial video and finally be able to stop giving trainings. Ast least for a while.

## The Now
Ok we're finally at present day! With all of the past phases in mind, I'm now more committed to finishing up the tutorial and pushing it across the finish line to finally achieve independence! I finished a PowerPoint a few weeks ago, which even contains the narration for each page, and possible animations I'll add in. This week I'm hoping to finish the narrations, and next week I will try to put it all together and publish it on YouTube. I think it could be useful for me (and maybe others) to learn how to make a video from PowerPoint slides, add sound and animations, and finalize everything by posting it on YouTube. Here are my notes from the process so far. [^7]

## The Process
1. Begin with a goal
    - My goal is to create a tutorial video that covers all basic aspects of our database management system and doesn't put the listener to sleep.
2. Outline the tutorial
    - Brief introduction to our system
    - Explain why we started using our system at work
    - Any tasks needed before using the system
    - How to use the system (step by step)
    - Recap
3. Fill it in
    - Fill in each item with pictures, animations, etc.
    - Add enough detail to get the points across, without crowding the page or boring the listener.
4. Write a narration
    - On each page of the powerpoint, write what you'll say (in the video) in the "Notes" section.
    - This will help when you're recording the narration for each page.
5. Record the narration
    - Using your favorite sound recording device, record the narration
    - **Note**: I tried using the built-in Powerpoint audio recorder, but it didn't go well for me. Plus the microphone on my computer is pretty terrible compared to the microphone on my phone.
    - **Note 2**: Useful audio file conversion sites (from .3gpp to .mp3) can be found after the `Ending Remarks` section below.
6. Add narration to presentation
    - Add sound file to slide by following these steps:
        1. Select slide you want to add audio to
        2. Click `Insert` -> `Sound` (from file)
        3. Add your sound file
            - **Note**: Not all file types are supported
    - Your sound file will show up with a little speaker symbol around the middle of the slide. I didn't want users to see this symbol, so I just dragged the symbol off the screen. You can also get into the sound's animation settings, find `Sound Settings`, and select `Hide sound icon during slide show`.
    - **Note 2**: To edit sound files to your liking, I'd recommend using [Audacity](https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/?source=typ_redirect).
7. Add "animation" to narration
    - To make sure your sound file starts playing at the right moment, open up the `Custom Animation` panel by navigating to `Animations` -> `Custom Animation`.
    - I wanted all of my narrations to begin right when the slide changes, so I set the `Start` value to `With Previous` for all sound files. 
8. Turn presentation into video
    - Once all of the timings are set up well so you can basically play your presentation without touching any buttons, go to `File` -> `Save & Send` -> `Create a Video`
    - This will create a `.wmv` video, in the directory of your choosing.
     - **Note**: I started using Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, but only versions 2010 and above can create / export videos from powerpoint format.
9. Upload to YouTube
    - To do this, you must have a Google account.
    - Navigate to YouTube, then click the icon that looks like a video camera with a `+` symbol inside it. When you hover over the icon, you should see the tooltop say `"Create a video or post"`.
    - Next, select `"Upload Video"`, then upload!
10. Add links / popups to videos
    - In order to add links to your videos, edit a video and go to `Cards`. Then, click `Add card`, and finally click `Link`.
        - **Note**: To be eligible to use this feature, you must be a part of the `YouTube Partner Program`, and to apply for this you must have over 4000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and 1000 subscribers to your channel. Otherwise, you will not be eligible.
    - I wanted to add cards, but I absolutely am not eligible for the `YouTube Partner Program`. So instead, I just added links to the video's description.

## Ending Remarks
In the end, creating a video from a PowerPoint seems pretty simple, but I'm very glad I went through the exercise of taking notes along the way since it was much more frustrating than I expected. The main pain points had to do with the fact that I used an old version of PowerPoint (2007) which doesn't have the feature I wanted, and converting to the 2010 version forced me to redo a decent amount of work.

When I run through this process again, uploading the second half of my tutorial to YouTube, I'll come back to this post and add any new findings. Hopefully this post can make someone's life a little easier.

As always, thanks for reading :)

[^1]: People = me, current staff, future staff, and maybe even employees at other organizations.

[^2]: Since I was "the system administrator", I became the liaison between my colleagues & the developers to make sure these bugs got fixed.

[^3]: If you already know what I'm about to say, I'm sorry. But... I'm going to say it anyway.

[^4]: I'm always hopeful when I hear staff members get resettled - hopeful that they find a community and a home as welcoming as that of my current employer.

[^5]: I didn't just say "screw you I'm doing this my way" to my colleagues, by the way... I got this plan approved by department heads & my boss. Shut up.

[^6]: "Going live" is when your company starts using some software (in this case, a database management system) in the production system.

[^7]: Note: I delayed publishing this post for a few days so that I could run through the entire process with the first half of the tutorial.
