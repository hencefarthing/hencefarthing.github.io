excerpt: Sorry bro... It's time we write again :)

The last few months have seemed to evaporate in a whirlwind...

I've been:

1. Coding, coordinating, and training for my full-time job
1. Coding for my other part-time job
1. Traveling
    - August 2019: Ukraine
    - September 2019: Germany
    - October 2019: Florida
    - January 2020: India
1. Planning my exit from Egypt
1. Planning long-term future activities (more details later)

And yeah, obviously some unproductive things too - mainly watching YouTube videos from these channels...

-   [The Late Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig)
-   [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)
-   [Ryan Williams](https://www.youtube.com/user/roodle22/)
-   [Professional Overwatch](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kephri1)

But _seriously, Logan!!_ I **DO want to** _write <u>MORE</u>_!!

Hopefully we can get back into sharing our lives and dreams and adventures, because my texting game is far from ~perfect~ good.

    Our mission... Should we choose to accept it... Is to write 1 full-length post and 1 brief in the month of February.

    If we succeed... Life as we know it will continue in all its glory and we will be enriched beyond our wildest dreams.

    If we fail... Well... We better not fail. For the good of our future children, and our future children's children. Maybe even for the good of our future children's children's children...

Wha'da'ya'say? ;)
