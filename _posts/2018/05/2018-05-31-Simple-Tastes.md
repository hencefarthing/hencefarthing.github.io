A quick word before today's post: This month (May), Alex & I tried something new: A Monthly Theme. Alex explained a bit better in his post a couple days ago[^0]. All I have to add is that we posted our Monthly May themes on the 29th and the 31st‚Ä¶ Go team!! ü§úüèºüí¢ü§õüèº

# On Simple Tastes
Lately, I've been into making more of my own food. There are lots silly reasons why, as well as a few logical ones[^1]; but the biggest thing that drives me to do it is my own enjoyment. I like making things, and I like learning how things are made.  
Lots of this probably started a couple years ago after my sister got me a KitchenAid stand mixer as a holiday gift. I started off making cookies, because cookies are delicious. I slowly progressed on from there, trying new recipes for breads, cinnamon rolls, biscuits. Some recipes are harder than others, or take more time. Most I've screwed up -- most of those I managed to improvise something that worked, but more than a few never recovered from my mistakes. And yet, even the failed French Bread that was roughly the same density as a rock was enjoyable to eat[^2].  
There is just something magical about taking a few ingredients, doing something with them, and ending up with something you can eat. Do you have baking powder, flour, and milk in your kitchen? You actually have biscuits![^3] Flour and eggs? You can make noodles! If you keep the raw ingredients around, the only thing stopping you from having cake or a warm loaf of bread or muffins is a little time and effort. But anyway, back on topic‚Ä¶[^4]  

## A Noodle Runs Through It
My sister followed up on the mixer by giving me a pasta roller attachment set for my birthday 6 month later![^5] Obviously, this led to me making my own pasta, and I would bet that most of the pasta my wife & I have eaten since, I have hand made. The recipe as evolved over time, but most recently is essentially the same as [this one][sepasta] that [Serious Eats][se] came up with.[^6]
It take a grand total of 2 ingredients to make fresh pasta! I wouldn't've guessed before I tried making it myself. And the texture of the pasta when you're rolling it out is incredibly satisfying, not to mention that it boils much faster than boxed pasta from the store.  
Personally, I like to make this pasta and eat with a simple red sauce, a [light alfredo][sesause], or even just olive oil & parmesan cheese. But I'm a simple man who like simple flavors, so you may wish to experiment a bit more!

## Honey & Bunches of Oats
But not every thing you eat can (·¥è Ä s ú·¥è·¥ú ü·¥Ö) be breads, pastas, or carbs. The last few months I've been trying to have a more balanced diet[^7]. *Turns out*, baked goods aren't the best for your health and are harder to squeeze into a diet with fewer carbs and significantly less processed carbs, fats, and sugars. So this past weekend when we were looking for a healthy snack to share at a gathering, my recipe collection turned up completely useless.  

Luckily, we fiddled around and found a recipe involving oats, honey, almonds, and dried berries. But since it is granola, we can really put whatever we want in there and it will work. And let me tell you, it is some of the best granola I've had! It only took 30 min to roast in the oven and we've been eating it for the whole week!

## The Part Where I'm Honest With the Reader
I wrote most of this a week ago. The last few sentences I tried to tack on today, but forgot where I had been going with it. I apologize for not putting my best foot forward at the end there. But I can pull out the key ideas for you:
- I like food
- I like food so much I make my own
- It's ok to be healthy while still liking food

[^0]: I think, time zones are weird.  

[^1]: Without specifying which is which: knowing what is in my food, avoiding additives & preservatives, being able to pick ingredients that fit my nutritional goals, fresher food, yummier food, plainer food with less concentrated salts and sugars.  
[^2]: Ok, so it wasn‚Äôt *that* good. But I‚Äôm stubborn so I ate it anyway.  
[^3]: In the American sense. Round bready things you eat with butter and honey. Or breakfast sausage to make little sandwiches. I‚Äôm making myself hungry writing this.  
[^4]: Ha! Like we have a topic ü§£ 

[^5]: In case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, my sister is pretty awesome. Probably the best sister ever.
