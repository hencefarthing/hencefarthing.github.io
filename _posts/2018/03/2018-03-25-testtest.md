Some test code to mess around with! Woot!

## Code

```javascript
document.onload()
console.log()
```

## lists
- top level
  - second
    - third

1. top
  1. seoncd
  1. moar
    1. third
    1. bullet
      - huh
      
1) try parens
  - ok this is here
    - 2?
  - back to 1
    - back to 2?
    
1. Too much space?
    - level 2?
        - 3!
    - back to 2
        - so far
            - last one?

## tags notes
- Can set up tags as array: `[one, two, 3, two words]`
- OR can set up like this: `one two 3 two-words`
- **Note**: If you want multi-word tags without spaces, must use array `[]` format. Otherwise, just use `-` character between words.
