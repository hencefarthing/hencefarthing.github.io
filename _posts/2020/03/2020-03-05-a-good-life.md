excerpt: These are my rules for living a good life. 
---
When I first set out to write a doctrine for myself, I had this notion that I would compile a hefty tome. I had an idea that it would be my life's work and be worthy of study by others. Not only that, but it would solve all my problems and make me a better human just by existing.  
Then I remembered that life is messy and complicated and hard and the existence of any single text changes almost nothing.  
Then I remembered who I am. Basically no one.  
And finally I remembered what kinds of things work for me. And they're not thick, obtuse crypts of indecipherable wisdom. What gets to me is simple logic expressed by simpler rules. So I decided to practice what I intended to preach to myself[^1] and cut back. This is what remains.

## The Five ##
You want to be a good, happy, fulfilled person? Try to do these things. And since you're human, cut yourself some slack. Maybe to make it achievable just throw a `more` on the end of each sentence.
- Be Kind.
- Pay Attention.
- Cut the Bullshit.
- Do the Hard Stuff.
- Make Things You Love.

## Detailed Rules ##
You want to really get in the weeds? Here's my detailed guides for how to live a healthy life. Healthy for your body, healthy for your mind, healthy for your soul, healthy for the world, healthy for us all.
- Eat. Not too much. Mostly plants.
- Sleep. Regularly. Mostly at night.
- Move.
- Think. Not too much.
- Talk. Listen more. Mostly in person.
- Read. Not too much. Mostly facts.

## Useful Spectrums ##
You can think of these as filters through which to view the world. Different measuring sticks. None of these should be construed as "good" or "bad". There is a time for them all. This is simply a toolset to help make sense of the world.
- Analog ↔ Digital[^2]
- Emergence
- Primitive Mind ↔ Higher Mind[^3]
- Simplicity ↔ complexity

I would like to compile a document with my sources, inspiration, and logic. But I haven't yet. If you have any specific questions, let me know. I've reread this in its current form for several months now. It has served me well.
