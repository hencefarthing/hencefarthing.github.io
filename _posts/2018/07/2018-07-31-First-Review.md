What to write about, what to write about... Aha! Reviews! In the past few years, I've taken it upon myself to write some serious online reviews. [^1] About what? Some games, some apps, some products I've purchased on Amazon, some resorts I've stayed at near the Red Sea, etc... Basically I've been a bit more conscious about how reviews can leave a real impact on people's decision making.

# Clarifying backstory

I'd like to think that my life has left an impact on others. Usually when I say this, or when people say something similar, we don't mean "I hope lots of people read all of the reviews I write about all of the many products I use from day to day". But why not?

Last March, I traveled with my good friend Dina back from Egypt to the US. We flew in through Los Angeles (LA), took a bus to Las Vegas (LV), flew to Denver, Colorado, flew to Reno, Nevada, drove to San Francisco, California, then drove back down to LA for our flight back to Cairo. It was a super fun adventure, but along the way we definitely ran into a few hiccups. One such hiccup could have been avoided if we had read some AirBNB reviews more carefully :)

## A hiccup

As a full-time "tourist" in the Middle East, my salary is pretty small. So when I decide I want to take the intercontinental journey back to my homeland, I have to decide where to spend my money and where to save. Dina and I decided one place where we could save money and sacrifice a little bit of quality is in our choice of accommodation. In Denver we would be staying with my best friend Logan, in Reno we would stay with my mom, and in San Francisco we would stay with an old High School friend Trevor, but we still had to figure out how to survive in LA and LV. In LA we found a decent AirBNB which was shared with 5 or 6 other rooms, 2 bathrooms, and had a very nice tenant. Our stay there was lovely and we had no complaints. [^2] Our stay in LV was... not as peaceful.

After our long bus ride from LA to LV, Dina and I arrived at our destination. Not our AirBNB, but some abandoned bus station kindof near downtown. We were both a bit tired from the drive, so we planned to quickly get to the apartment so we could get some rest before we headed back out. It took us a few minutes to get our bearings, but eventually we found a public bus stop that would take us where we needed to go. We dragged our luggage onto and off of two different busses, and finally arrived outside the apartment complex where our AirBNB host lived. I'll cut a bit out of the story - the part where we wandered around for about 20 minutes in the heat, looking for our host's address - and join back up when we saw Dina's room for the night.

At first glance, the door was ajar. That's normal, there's no reason a room must be closed off, especially when nobody is living there at the moment. Looking more closely at the spot where you normally push a door open, the handle, we found just a wrecked brass knob which fit so loosely through the door that you could easily notice there was no connecting half on the other side. The door had obviously been busted open, which set off lots of alarms in our heads. Our host casually noted that the previous renter had accidentally locked his room key inside, so they had to bust down the door to get inside. Ordinarily he would have a room key for Dina, but he hadn't had time to buy a new doorknob, so she would have to wait till the next day for a lockable door. This did not sit well with either of us. We couldn't force the host to go buy a lock, so what could we do? Our first thought was to check if anyone had left a review on AirBNB mentioning any other sketchy situation at this apartment. Before booking, we had taken note of the average rating that travelers had left, and we remembered it not being terrible or great, but we hadn't read specific reviews. We jumped on the website, found the profile for this apartment, and went straight for the one-star reviews. Almost immediately we found a review from a lady who mentioned how terrified she was to stay in that room. She commented how the neighborhood was sketchy, the bathroom was gross, the host seemed weirdly spacey, and she overall felt scared to fall asleep. So she didn't! She literally left the night she got there. If we had seen that review before renting, we definitely would have looked for a different host. But at that point, we felt it was too late. We didn't have the energy or resources to quickly find another solution.

To cut that story a bit short, Dina ended up moving a dresser in front of the door at night so she would at least hear something if anyone tried breaking in. She ended up being ok for the few days we stayed there, and we still were able to have a great time in LV. Despite the fact that everything turned out ok, we will never forget this crazy encounter, and will probably be much more picky with future housing options.

## Le caveat(s)

Although I'm getting more into writing review, I want you, the reader, to understand that I'm not thinking I just found the newest way to stay safe and get the best of every situation. Reading reviews are not always going to keep you safe from risky products and servies, nor will writing reviews prevent everyone from the same. Here are some caveats I've thought of, which intrigue me while at the same time, may make my series of reviews relatively worthless (oops). 

### Best of everything!

Everyone wants to save money and use good quality products. Ok, maybe that's just me in my current state of mind. But as I get older, I think I'll also like to take less risks. For example, when you're young, you don't worry as much about breaking your arm because you're pretty sure you'll bounce back in a reasonable amount of time. Now that I'm [INSERT_AGE_HERE] years old, I feel like I would be pretty disappointed if my arm didn't work. Eating would be more difficult, programming would be much slower, *blah blah blah, complain complain complain*.

So can we have it all? Can we read all of the reviews available in the world effectively minimize money spent and risks taken while getting the best quality option? No... I don't believe that's how the world works. One reason I would say no is that - if a product is good quality (and therefore not super risky to purchase), it is probably worth a lot of money - so you'll have to ignore your desire to be frugal. Additionally, as you all may know, very cheap products often seem like they are good quality. However, they stereotypically come with a risk that they may break easily, not function at all, or something else entirely. Finally, how can we combine a low risk and low price? An example of this would be Frontier Airlines. They're one of the cheapest airlines in the business, but how would you rate their quality? If you've ever flown on their airplanes, you would definitely understand the saying "you get what you pay for". The seats are pretty tightly packed and often uncomfortable AND you have to pay extra fees for additional baggage. OK, this last example was a bit too specific, I'm going to back out now - maybe you love Frontier, keep flying with them. My point is nearly impossible to truly get the best of everything.

### A sea of reviews

When products have thousands or millions of reviews, how can the real, productive, insightful reviews surface? Should people be expected to sift through all of the crazy reviews before making any decision in life? Like where to buy a toothbrush, or which socks to buy? Herein lies an interesting conundrum. I don't think it's useful for people to rate every single product on Earth [^3]. However... Which products should get "the shaft", or be left out due to "unimportance" (for lack of a better word)? It could make sense to only scoure through reviews for the more "life-changing" events in life, like what kind of car to buy, or what airline to fly on. But why would I only look for happiness in those times of my life? I want my hairtie to feel the most comfortable on my growing ponytail. I want my fingernail trimmers to ["cut with such precision that the cut is clean"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MQUCD15LP1WO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F35R00). I should never have to settle for a potentially [bowel-threatening package of gummy bears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VMCBUQCHYQNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006J1FBLM) when my hours of research could lead me to a slightly less life-threatening product. I have no conclusion here, but I wish to offer my most sincere "good vibes" to anyone on either end of the spectrum presented here: those of you who take no heed to the sea of reviews, or those of you who consistently and knowingly take on the horde, expecting that there is one perfect review out there that will make up your mind for you. 

# This month's review

Ok, now to the real topic of this post :) So... This month I was a bit too late coming up with something to review, so I haven't actually written any reviews in July. [^4] Instead, I'll share a review I wrote for a little vacation resort on the Red Sea called [Palm Beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palm+Beach+-+Family+Tours+Ain+El+Sokhna/@29.7413198,32.3907338,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!1m3!8m2!1e1!2s116837711879789507840!3m4!1s0x14564b739248fa2f:0x806f4f984865dddd!8m2!3d29.7413152!4d32.3929225). My family and I stayed there in May of this year, and we had a pretty relaxing time. Check it out below:

    I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. Here's why. I came to Palm Beach with the intent to get away from Cairo heat for a while, relax on the beach, enjoy the huge beautiful pool, and overall chill as much as possible. I came during the first weekend of Ramadan (maybe that's my mistake), and a few things were off. The huge pool advertised in many photos was full of green water - they weren't letting anyone in. Also, the water in my room turned completely off for at least 6 hours total every day. If we had not brought our own box of waters, we would have been in a very rough situation. Other than those two issues,  the room was clean, air conditioning in every room worked well, the beach was clean and perfect (sand was soft,  many nice umbrellas and chairs to shade you from the sun). The staff member at the check-in counter was also very friendly. If you stay here, bring your own food and water, and obviously a bathing suit 😊

After reading this review I wrote only 2 months ago, I have a few comments for myself. First, easy to troll, second, how long should a review be? As I mentioned above, people probably don't have the time to just sit around, reading reviews all day... So it sounds beneficial to write reviews as short and to-the-point as possible. Does that make sense to you, reader? Do you think you would take the time to read my 10-sentence review? Let me know what you think! I'm genuinely interested :)

# Improve, please?

In the future, I plan to add little comments about how each "thing" I review can improve. It's pretty obvious what one of my suggested "improvements" would be - like making sure the water stayed on the entire day - so I want to dig a bit more into another suggestion, which also seems pretty obvious at first. I want to talk a bit about how a resort like Palm Beach could go about warning users that their pool is "offline".

First, while someone is reserving a room over the phone, it would be easy for that employee to warn the customer that the giant, delicious looking pool is out of service at the moment. Sure, this would potentially drive some customers away, but if someone like me comes and stays in your resort and gives you a nasty review, that could potentially drive business away (assuming people read reviews these days).

Second, update the website. It can't be THAT hard, right? [^5] Let's consider a few options for updating the website.

1. Add some small text near the pool picture warning customers to ask about pool outages.
    - They could even make it sound like the pool is rarely out of service by saying something like "... during Radaman" or "... during Winter". That way, Summer customers would not be worried at all and if you're reserving a place in one of those mentioned time-periods, you have the option of calling and asking about the pool being open! Ok, maybe everyone should always do this - *expect* the unexpected. But still, it would be a nice touch for the resort owners to act like they care a little more about their customers.
1. Add a calendar displaying the pool cleaning schedule, and show this near the picture of the pool.
    - This may not be "georgous" to look at, but at least it's a proper warning! If Palm Beach doesn't have "regular" pool cleaning schedules, they could still easily integrate a Google Calendar onto the site (see these [amazingly simple instructions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en)). With Google Calendar integration, you can update your Google Calendar with any upcoming cleanings, and BOOM your website is displaying it to your customers.
1. Directly edit the website each time the pool cleaning happens.
    - I put this option last because it requires the most work, so it's probably the least feasible. It would be nice for customers to see the most up-to-date information at all times, but editing a website directly (and often) could potentially lead to accidental errors - especially if you directly edit the code.

Instead of following either of the plans above, they gave us a discount. *Technically* they didn't say the discount was applied due to the pool outage, and even if that's the reason for the discount, I can imagine other more volitile people being furious that their mega pool wasn't open, ready for their bodies.

# And now you have it

Now you have it. Some things to think about while you're visiting the oval office (seriously, read that gummy bear review I linked to above), a little story about my trip to the US last March, a review on a beach resort at the Red Sea, and hopefully a bit of entertainment.

I hope all of this didn't come across as some useless rambling from some random dude... I hope it got you thinking a bit (as it did, me). I "plan" to start reviewing things regularly, maybe once per month, and posting those reviews here. Just for fun. I think I would enjoy reviewing a variety of products / services / anything, like websites, apps, restaurants, stores, etc. Hopefully you enjoy as well.

Thanks for reading :)


[^1]: Not "serious" like "I just made some *serious* cash!" but more like... "*Why... So... Serious...*" - I hope that cleared things up.

[^2]: Hopefully we left a great review there - I should go check...

[^3]: Intriguingly, this ties into Season 3, Episode 1 of Black Mirror, one of my favorite TV shows... I'd highly recommend checking out that show :)

[^4]: I probably could have told you this review was from July... Shoot.

[^5]: As a web developer, I had to think about this for a second, and... **NOPE** it's not difficult at all.
