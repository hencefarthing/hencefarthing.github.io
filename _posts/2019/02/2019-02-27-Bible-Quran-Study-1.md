These days I find myself trapped in a decent amount of routines. From work to frisbee, eating to sleeping, answering questions on StackOverflow [^1] to binge watching a show on Netflix / hours of YouTube / watching The Office... again. But recently I've picked up something new that I hope to make a more regular part of my life - studying religious texts. [^2]

For those of you who may be from a Western culture, or if you believe in Christianity, please don't freak out when I mention that I'm intending on putting effort into studying the Bible _as well as_ the Quran. I'm not "converting" to Islam [^3], I'm simply trying to work on a few things in my life. First and foremost, I want to get closer to my lady friend. She is an amazing Egyptian lady who happens to believe in Islam, and I am very interested in similarities and differences in what we believe. We have very similar morals, but often a few specific differences in religious beliefs come up when we're discussing faith. I try to put myself in her shoes when hearing her thoughts, but I tend to get caught up on some minute details. Often I'll end up derailing these types of conversations on accident, but hopefully with practice I'll get better. [^4]

I also heard recently about Islam as more of a "continuation" of other beliefs, or something that "builds upon" Christianity, as a way of tuning beliefs in the right direction. I think this is an interesting idea, as it seems some religious people get lost in tradition and old ways of thinking. Maybe I'm also one of those people? It's also interesting to see how this benign way of thinking morphed into intense hatred between believers of different faiths. This is very sad since I know there are many lovely Muslims as well as many lovely Christians. Alicia and I believe that most people want to be "correct" in what they believe [^5], but how can we ever truly know if **we** are the correct ones? When there are hundreds of millions of people who wholeheartedly believe in their Holy Book and their view of God, who is to say that one side is _DEFINITELY_ correct? Also, does that even matter, as long as we're all striving to get closer to God and loving Him and others along the way?

These questions are a few of many that I wish to answer during these studies with Alicia. I am lucky to have such an amazing sister who is willing to question her own beliefs and who is willing (and excited about) learning about a different religion, studyied and believed by my lovely Dina.

# What to study?

In our quest to answer the few questions I've mentioned above (and many more questions I haven't even fathomed yet), my sister and I will be studying both the Bible and the Quran. We are beginning our Bible study by revisiting the Gospel of Matthew, and we will see where we go from there. On the Quran side, my sister bought a book called "The Study Quran, a new translation and commentary." We'll be studying that one along with its commentary for starters.

# Studying the Quran

## General Introduction (P.xxiii)

- Al-Quran means "The Recitation." The Book (Quran) was revealed by Gabriel (an angel) to "The Prophet" (Mohammed) during his 23 years alive. His words were directly from God.
    - The Quran is only from Mohammed. The Bible was written by many different people.
- "The Quran was a reality before its revelation / descent to the Prophet, and therefore not his own words."

## The Message of the Quran (P. xxv)

- I've heard a few times about the "many names of God" and in this intro I see "As the Quran itself states, Unto God belong the Most Beautiful Names" - believers must call upon Him with these Names
    - I didn't know this until discussing with Alicia, but this is similar to Bible! It's not as common in the US to name children by God's names though.

- Big claim of an all-encompasing Quran:
    - "The Quran also deals fully with the nature of human beings. It teaches us who we are, why we were created and placed here on earth, what our goal in life is, what our responsibilities and rights are accoring to the Divine Law, what we need to know about the immortality of the human soul and its posthumous states, and the consequences of how we live in this world for our state of being after death"
    - Additionally, the Quran _also_ deals with the importance of man / woman pairs, sexuality, family, responsibilities of men / women in marraige. "Also treated is the correct relationship between the individual, society, and the rest of God's creation".
    - It seem like this book will not leave anything up to choice? I guess that could be good since humans often get things wrong? Also the Quran has lots of teachings on the stars and outer space / cosmology, as well as nature revealing "Divine Wisdom" which could be interesting. I haven't heard of similar knowledge in the Bible, but maybe it's there somewhere.

- The Quran possesses layers of meanings - an "outward" meeting and several "inward" meanings - including the most inward which is only known to God. To completely understand the full teachings of the book, one must grasp the multiple levels of meaning of the Quran.
    - If there's a level that only God understands, how is anyone able to fully understand the book? This sounds similar to how I believe it's impossible to fully grasp God, in the Christian belief. It helps to study, but it's not possible to understand everything 100%. In my opinion this is both fantastic (we must continually strive to learn and get closer to God) and also frustrating [^6].

- Interesting quote: "... from a Quranic perspective the rights of the individual and those of society are not in tension or opposition with each other, as they are sometimes perceived to be in modern Western societies." - I'm not 100% sure what these tensions are?

- "Paying attention to the inner meaning of the Quran results in the realization that not only does it contain teaching about _creating a just social order and leading a virtuous life that results in a return to God **after** death in a felicitous state_, it _also provides the means of returning to God here and now while still in this world_" - interesting!

- A "chapter" of the Quran is called a `surah`.

- Cyclical events - a message is passed to people via a prophet, gradually people forget what the message is, particularly the people the message was meant for, and often some Divine calamity, followed by the coming of a new prophet. The end of these cycles comes around the time of the Prophet if Islam, the Seal of prophets (33:40), which is basically around the end of the world.
    - Also mentioned is some reference to life after death, but the Quran is only meant to be a guide for this life, so potentially there's not much mention of this post-humanity life.
    - But it says "the hereafter" - Heaven, I assume - is often on people's minds, as well as punishments of Hell. Maybe the Quran just doesn't describe Heaven / Hell in much detail, just warns about them?
    - Also this cyclical nature of people sinning and Jesus describing new laws is present in the Bible. I think this is similar, no?

- The Quran contains language that can be understood by the simplest believers, as well as symbolic and crazy intense language "to satisfy the needs of sages and saints."
    - I find this last part interesting because it seems that people would get different meanings of out text that has multiple levels of language used. If a simple believer / someone who only understands simple Arabic reads the Quran and doesn't understand the more symbolic words / themes, would they be missing something? I assume yes?

- Interesting claim: "Without the advent of the Quran, there would have been no Islamic sciences as we know them, sciences that were brought later to the West and we therefore would not have words such as 'algebra' 'algorithm' and many other scientific terms of Arabic origin in English" - pow! The Quran is a book of knowledge.

- "It is because of the message of the Quran that before modern times Muslims were the first people to develop ... the science of religions, _Religionswissenschaft_, and to write in a scholary fashion about other religions" - even _Indica_ of Abu Rayhan al-Biruni.

Overall, the Quran is a "guide for every conceivable aspect of human life, action, and thought..."

## Differences between the Quran and the Bible
- "Biblical accounts have a more historical nature, Quranic sacred history is more ahistorical and is revealed primarily to teach ethical and spiritual lessons" - history from the Quran is more about teaching Muslims about their human soul (good and bad things) and what will happen if they take recourse in God


## My Questions
- "The import of this sacred history is meant to be universal, since the Islamic revelation is addressed to all of humanity rather than to a particular people, as is the case with Judaism"
    - Is the author saying Judaism is addressed to a specific people, the Isrealites? I can't tell if this is written in a kinda condescending / pointed way, or if I'm just feeling defensive haha.
- "The Quranic message is based on the universality of revelation, and the Sacred Text states explicitly that there are _no_ people to whom God has not sent a messenger (16:36).
    - What about babies? Or people who grow up in 'Murica with only Christian background? Is Christianity considered part of Islam, so it still counts as them receiving "a message" / "a messenger"? I guess so, Abraham and Jesus were considered messengers! So supposedly everyone everyone has been sent a messenger... I thought the Bible said something about - once everyone on Earth has heard the good news, that'll be around the time of judgement day? I totally don't remember that verse or book, maybe in Revelations? Maybe I'm crazy!


## Words I had to learn
- theophany "it is the central theophany of Islam"
- philology "study of Semitic philology"
- posthumous "the immortality of the human soul and its posthumous states"
- eschatology: "the part of theology concerned with death, judgement, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind." 
- felicitous "a return to God after death in a felicitous state"
- sapiential: "relating to wisdom"
- beatitude
- jurisprudence
- didactic

# Studying the Bible

## Matthew (in the New Testament) - part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dv4-n6OYGI

- One of the earliest accounts of the Jesus of Nazareth - his life, death, and resurrection
- Over 30 - 40 years of oral tradition brought into one book (Matthew) - by Matthew - designed to highlight themes about jesus
- Jesus is the continuation and fulfillment of the biblical story - he's the messiah from the line of David, a new teacher like Moses. Jesus is God with us (Emmanuel)
- Chap 1 - 3: connect Jesus to old testament
    - Geniology about Jesus that highlights how he is from the messianic line of the son of David, and he is a son of Abraham (he will bring God's blessing to all of the nations)
    - Jesus' birth fulfills prophetic promises from old testament
    - Jesus' conception by the holy spirit
    - -> Jesus is no mere human, he is God with us / God become human
- Jesus like a new Moses
    - Mathew is claiming that Jesus is the promised figure, greater than Moses (similar but greater)
    - He is going to deliver Israel from slavery, give them new divine teaching, save them from their sins and bring about a new covenant relationship between God and his people
    - This parallel between Moses and Jesus explains why Matthew structured the center of the books like this - 5 main points highlight Jesus as a teacher - parells the 5 books of Moses
- Chap 4 - 7: Jesus announces the arrival of God's kingdom - rescue the world! 
    - Jesus will confront evil, restore God's rule and reign over the world by creating a family of followers who obey his teaching & live under his rule
    - First block of teaching = sermon on the mount - what it looks like to follow him & live in God's kingdom.
        - Upside-down: no prilidged people (poor, wealthy, religious, etc - everyone is called to repent and join his family)
    - Not here to set aside commands of the Torah, but to fulfill them through his life
    - Here to transofrm the hearts of his people so they can truly love God, their neighbor, and their enemy
- Chap 8-10: bringing the kingdom into the lives of people

# Thank you

So there you have it! Above are the notes from my first discussion with Alicia regarding the Bible and the Quran. Thanks for reading!

Alicia and I discussed the above topics more than a month before finishing this post, so sorry it has taken me so long to finish this up. I wasn't sure how to display all of my thoughts, but I've decided I'm just going to leave it like this for now - a summary of notes & thoughts in bullet-point fashion, with a few takeaways and next steps below.

## Some takeaways

1. Start the day by asking god to reveal himself somehow
    - It's easier to notice God's work in your life when you're looking for Him. I'm not good at this yet, but it's something I'm interested in making a habit of.
1. Acts 17:27 - at least search for God
    - Just like "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take," you can't find God without at least doing some searching. Is that a weird analogy? Maybe, but it makes sense to my brain :D
1. Much more that I didn't write down :(

## Next steps

For our next discussion, we've decided to read / watch and take notes on the following:
- 2nd part of Matthew (YouTube video) + reading one of the chapters of the gospel of Matthew
- Start "The Study Quran" from "reading the study quran" (xl)

I love earning fake internet points, so if you're interesting in seeing my profile, [check it out](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2430414/blundering-philosopher) :)

[^2]: I purposefully didn't just say "studying the Bible" since I'm also studying the Quran!

[^3]: Or at least, not yet! 😮

[^4]: I think one reason I accidentally derail our conversations about differences between Christianity and Islam is that I may be defensive about my beliefs? It's difficult for me to analyze this properly, so I may need Dina to confirm or deny this analysis.

[^5]: Duh?

[^6]: I feel it can be frustrating not knowing God's plan for my life, and not completely understanding some things. Like why is there room for interpretation (in both the Bible and the Quran) if these books are so holy and from God? Are they meant to be clear but humans aren't smart enough to understand? Or did someone lead us astray? Or are they intentionally a bit confusing?
