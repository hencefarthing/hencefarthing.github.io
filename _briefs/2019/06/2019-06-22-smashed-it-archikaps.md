Time for another mini review of an android game :D

I just finished the final level of [Archikaps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.achikaps) and I'm honestly seriously considering going [pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.achikaps_pro). The free version took me about 2 weeks to beat. Many levels are just intro so you get used to how specific buildings work, since there are about 29 different buildings and 14 types of "minerals". The rules are slightly different on each level (sometimes you need electricity to keep modules running, sometimes you don't) which keeps the game exciting and each level unique. It's also pretty fun to see if you can build a large base that acts as a well-oiled machine (see start & end pics below). I rated this game 5 out of 5 stars in the play store. Keep it up developers :)

Example: Level 44 start & end:
