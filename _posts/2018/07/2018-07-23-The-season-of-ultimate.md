BURLA, MishMash, B'n'E, BUX... What do all of these strange words and acronyms have in common? They're names of ultimate tournaments all over the world! How did little ol' Alex hear about these opportunities? I'll take you on a journey, giving a brief explanation of my story in the land of ultimate.

# Back in the Day

When I played ultimate in high school, I knew it was fun and I thought it was something I'd want to do for a long time. During my senior year, a few friends and I found out that a few neighboring schools had teams, so we collaborated with another high school to create a team [^1]. We ran a sort of mish-mash defense with a relatively random offense, but this worked for us since most other teams were used to only playing against standard strategies. After high school, I knew I wanted to keep playing, so I joined the team at CSM [^2]. I played on this team almost every year, but only for a few weeks before we had to play club dues to continue. During these few weeks I joined tournaments in Kansas and Las Vegas, and a few HAT tournaments hosted at home in Golden, Colorado.

After my Colorado days, I found myself working in Madison, Wisconsin. Unsurprisingly, I had to look for some sort of ultimate presence there. What I found was a massive community, collecting around 1000 players every year for their 4 unique seasonal leagues. To add to this, they had some of the top club teams in the country AND a pro team that was relatively new to the AUDL but already consistently reached 2nd in the nation. Work was a bit time and energy consuming for me at that time, so I didn't try out for any club team, but I joined the leagues straight away. My sister actually had a friend whose sister was getting a PHD in Chemistry in Madison, and she was also involved in these leagues! So on week 1 of my new job, I also met some crazy fun Chemistry nerds [^3] on the ultimate field! After 2 years of living and working in Madison, and 10 ultimate leagues, I decided it was time to move to a new adventure.

# Egypt

Again, I didn't love the idea of moving to a new country without playing ultimate, so I did some research [^4]. To my surprise, I found a nice, friendly community of ultimate players who were ready to accept me into their weekly practices. Woohoo! I arrived in Egypt on a Wednesday and started playing with this team on Friday [^5]. I quickly realized that this group was great, but wasn't growing. Somehow there are 19 million people living in Cairo, but only 15 - 20 coming to play ultimate every week. I discussed this thought with one of my first friends at the pickup, we decided Cairo needed more ultimate players, so we sat down and created FDI [^6].

The first 6 months of "spreading ultimate in Egypt" included jumping on social media and hitting the streets with discs. We even got about 20 of our friends to play ultimate behind the Pyramids!

Around this time, I saw a post on Facebook which changed my life. My friend Isaiah (who worked with me in Madison) was hosting an ultimate tournament in Kenya! [^7] I instantly got excited and signed up for the tournament, and about 1 day later so did my ultimate-addicted friend Tarek. Before embarking on this adventure, Tarek did something brilliant - he decided we would make a documentary out of the trip. This included taking some shots of all of the many various modes of transportation we used getting to the fields, players diving on the sand, even our tournament party featuring some local popular DJ. But the smartest thing we did for this documentary was interviewing the people who have been involved in spreading ultimate in Uganda and Kenya. We met some amazing people who have played a major part in ultimate growth in the region and we learned a lot from them. One of the most important takeaways was to create more competitions. People are naturally competitive, so if they see a new sport that has tournaments to compete in, they'll surely ask how to join, and get involved in the community. So we did just that! On the way back from Kenya (in Saudi Arabia's airport), Tarek and I planned out the first FDI tournament. [^8]

# Tournament Time

Ever since my first international ultimate tournament in Kenya, I've been interested in finding more tournaments to play in. Last November my great friend Dina and I traveled to Manila, Philippines to compete in Manila Spirits 2017. We heard about that tournament through a lady who joined our first beach ultimate tournament in Egypt [^9]. She invited some of our friends who, after telling us about it and adding us to the group Facebook page, backed out for various reasons. So Dina and I traveled across the world to play with a bunch of random players who literally hailed from at least 14 different nationalities. It was such an amazing experience. I wont discuss the details here too much, as that trip requires a separate post all on its own.

Here's what I'm trying to get at... It didn't take me long to get addicted to ultimate, and so far I've been lucky enough to find ultimate everwhere I've lived. But for a long time, I thought I would be satisfied participating in local leagues and tournaments. After tasting international competition, I have a new thirst to quench. Traveling has historically not been on my "top 5 favorite things to look forward to", but now all of that has changed. When I think about using my vacation days, I no longer think "maybe I'll take a long weekend and sleep". Instead, I'm actively looking for the next ultimate tournament to satisfy my craving.

On that note, I'll just mention a few future plans. Coming up at the end of September, I plan to attend a beach tournament in Italy called BURLA. One of my friends I met in the Philippines is joining that tournament with his team, so Dina and I are jumping on the bandwagon. We already purchased our flights and train ride, so we're committed! We also just found out about a tournament in Barcelona at the beginning of November, and some Egyptian friends have already made plans to join a tournament in Dubai around that same time. I'm super excited about the future since there's so much ULTIMATE!! Oh, and I almost forgot - FDI's next beach ultimate tournament is also coming up in mid August. Ok, that's about it for now :)

### To whoever reads this post:

If you're interested at all in playing ultimate, I'd highly recommend you try it out! The communities I've been a part of have all been very welcoming, full of kind, respectful people [^10]. Also, if you are interested in finding ultimate tournaments a bit easier, I'd recommend joining one of the mailing lists I linked to below, or visiting any of the tournament links below. These are all tournaments I've seriously considered joining, but obviously I live in the real world and cannot join every tournament I ever hear about.

I'm happy to discuss anything ultimate related with you (the reader) at any time, so hit me up if you have any questions!

As always, thanks for reading.

[^3]: It's ok, they like calling themselves nerds. I like to think I'm as nerdy as them, just in a different way...

[^4]: Honestly, even if ultimate didn't exist in Egypt, I probably would have survived for a while. But once I found ultimate, I was ready to stay for a long time :)

[^5]: UFE

[^6]: Flying Disc Invasion

[^7]: FEAST - Frisbee East Africa Sand Tournament. You can read more about the adventure in my posts about FEAST17

[^8]: ERUPT - Egypt Ramadan Ultimate Players Tournament

[^9]: BUX - Beach ultimate pick-10

[^10]: To be 100% honest, you'll always find that one asshole... But in my experience it's much more rare in ultimate communities.
