title: Game Over - I Win?
categories: games uncategorized
---

Recently I finished the final level (700 out of 700) in the first world of the smartphone game [Orbia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joxdev.orbia).

It took me a bit less than 10 hours of in-game play time to accomplish this, and over 2300 failed attempts. Overall I'd say that's not too bad, right? After completing this challenge, all I can think is: Did I win? Or did I just waste 10 hours of my life? Is it possible that I did both? ðŸ¤”
