Title: Podcasts (and Blogs) and Why They Matter

# [%Title]
So you just heard about podcasts for the first time. Maybe one of your more techie/internety friends told you about one of their favorites, or maybe someone said you should listen to their podcast.  And naturally, you're a little curious about why people are  passionate about podcasts. And now that you mention it, what is a podcast and how does it work? What makes podcasts different than other forms of media? Well buckle up, because I care deeply about all those things and I brought my soap box.  

## Where did podcasts come from?
"Podcast" is a portmanteau of "iPod" and "broadcast" — they were originally designed to be similar to radio broadcasts onto an iPod and listened to later. Originally this was done in a relatively haphazard and labor intensive way, but in 2005 Apple officially added support in iTunes and on the iPod, and eventually it became a default app that was preinstalled on every iPhone. It is undeniable that this origin reflects the amount of influence Apple has on podcasts to this day — the Apple Podcasts app is still the most popular method to listen to podcasts in the world. Indeed, Apple's iTunes Podcast directory is the de facto standard for looking at and finding podcasts, even in third-party apps or on other platforms.  

However, one of the things that makes podcasts truly specialvery little editorial control over it, and it is little more than an advanced phone book.[^5]  

## Well thats cool, but you still didn't tell me what a podcast is…
Technically speaking, a podcast is nothing more than an RSS feed that includes an audio file attachment. If you already know what an RSS feed is, you may skip to the next paragraph. Each article contains the associated title, author, body text, link to it online, and any necessary attachments. An RSS reader is an application made to automatically check these feeds and download the articles for reading later. The key point about RSS feeds is that they are an established standard that is free to read, and more importantly free for anyone to create. RSS feeds are what enabled the spread of blogs, web comics, and podcasts.  
Most podcasts add some additional data onto their RSS feeds that is required to be included in the iTunes directory. This includes things like if it is a show that contains seasons, if it contains explicit content, etc. A podcast player is nothing more than an RSS reader specifically designed to play audio files.  
Due to the open nature of the underlying technology, podcasts[^1] are one of the forms of media truly open to everyone and without gatekeepers. **Anyone** can create and publish a podcast, for better or for worse.[^2]

## While that may be technically correct, what are real podcasts actually like?
A podcast can be anything.  
Ok, ok. That's a bit of a cop out. Most podcasts resemble talk radio, but with a much more narrow focus.  Due to the nature of the internet, it is possible to make a niche podcast and still have thousands or millions of listeners. [The Pen Addict][TPA] is a _weekly_ show about what is new in the world of pens and stationary. Yes, you read that right. Weekly. Pens.
[Star Wars Minute][SWM] is a daily show in which the hosts and guest(s) analyze, scrutinize, and celebrate the Star Wars movies one minute at a time. Each episode covers a single minute of the movies. In release order. There are just under 800 episodes as I write this.
But there are also more traditionally produced shows with a broader appeal, such as [This American Life][TAL] and [TED Radio Hour][TED].  There's shows with inscrutable names like [Do By Friday][dbf] and [Hello Internet][hi], which are best described as people talking, and within which the subject matter varies greatly.  
Whatever the subject matter and whatever the style — from highly edited and produced to recorded on someone's phone — anyone can find a podcast that they will enjoy listening to. And because of this wide variety, it is nearly impossible to characterize podcasts as any one thing. It's almost like trying to answer the question "What are written words like?"  

## You Still Didn't Say Why They Are Important…
Right you are my fine feathered friend. Let's see if I can put this clearly and succinctly.  
> Podcasts and blogs are important because they democratize the flow of meaningful information and interaction in a way that is impossible  both without the internet and on the social and media giants that are most people's windows into the internet.  

I think that is a pretty good explanation, but I'll expand on it a bit.[^3]  
Before the advent of the internet, there was a dearth of opportunities for interacting and communicating with other humans relative to today. For all practical person, a person was limited to exchanging ideas with friends and friends-of-friends. Only the most privileged could have their thoughts and ideas published in a magazine or newspaper and distributed throughout the world, and even the reading of those words was limited to those who lived in the geographical area it would be distributed toand had the means to buy a book or other text. With nearly ubiquitous internet, anyone can publish anything and have it heard/read anywhere throughout the world.  
Unless, of course, they are writing within the walled garden of something like Facebook. Not only can people who don't have a Facebook account not read it, but the algorithms created by Facebook determines who can see it, and Facebook can **charge the poster of the content if they want to reach a certain number of people or a specific demographic.**[^4]  
And that is why the open technologies of blogs and podcasts are important: because they are available to _everyone_ and the only thing deciding how many readers/listeners/viewers you get is how good the content is. No one controls what we can say on the internet, and no one controls who see what you have to see. It truly is freedom of expression.  

And I didn't even talk about how awesome it is that they've avoided being taken over by advertisements and the attention economy that has destroyed "news". Maybe next time…
